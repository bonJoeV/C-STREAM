1. Identify what plants need to grow (water, light, soil)
2. Observe changes in plants over time
3. Record observations through drawing
4. Understand that plants are living things that grow and change

### Faith Integration Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Connect plant growth to Lenten themes of change and new life
2. Practice stewardship by caring for plants
3. Marvel at God's creation of living things

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Care for Creation** — God created plants and gave humans the job of taking care of the Earth. When we care for plants, we're doing God's work. During Lent, we focus on growing closer to God — just like plants grow toward the sun!

### Scripture Connection
> "Then God said, 'Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it.' And it was so."
> — Genesis 1:11

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how a tiny seed becomes a big plant? It's like a miracle!"

**Show a seed:**
> "Look at this tiny seed. It's so small! But inside this tiny seed is EVERYTHING needed to make a plant. Isn't that amazing?"

**Lent Connection:**

---

### 2. What Do Plants Need? (5 minutes)

---

### 3. Planting Time (12 minutes)

**Demonstrate planting:**
1. Put soil in cup (leave room at top)
2. Make a small hole with finger
3. Put seed in hole
4. Cover gently with soil
5. Water gently

**Students plant:**

- Each student plants 1-2 seeds

- Write name on cup

- Place in sunny spot

**While planting, discuss:**

- "Be gentle with the seed!"

- "The seed is going to sleep in the soil and then wake up and grow!"

- "We'll take care of it every day."

---

### 4. Closing & First Observation (4 minutes)

**Start observation journal:**
> "Scientists observe — they watch and record. We're going to watch our seeds and draw what we see."

**First entry:**

- Draw the cup with soil

- Date it

- Teacher writes: "Day 1 - Planted seed"

**Prayer:**
> "God, please help our seeds grow. Help us remember to care for them. And help US to grow during Lent too. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection

**Week 29 Note:**
> "We planted seeds today! Your child is learning about what plants need to grow: water, light, and soil. During Lent, we're connecting plant growth to our own spiritual growth. Ask your child: 'What did you plant? What does it need?'"

**Week 31 Note:**
> "Our plants grew! Your child observed and recorded changes over three weeks. If they're bringing their plant home, please help them continue caring for it. Plants need water (when soil is dry) and light. Ask your child to show you their observation journal!"
