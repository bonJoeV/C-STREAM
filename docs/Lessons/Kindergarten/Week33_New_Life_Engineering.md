## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Resurrection and New Life** — Easter celebrates the most important transformation ever — Jesus rising from the dead! Just like caterpillars transform into butterflies and seeds transform into plants, Jesus shows us that God brings new life from what seemed like an ending.

### Scripture Connection
> "I am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live, even after dying."
> — John 11:25

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how a crawling caterpillar becomes a flying butterfly? God loves transformation — changing things into something new and beautiful!"
