# Weeks 19-22: Exploration Stations

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### STEM Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Explore multiple STREAM areas independently
2. Make choices about their learning
3. Practice previously learned skills
4. Discover new interests

### Faith Integration Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Recognize that God gave everyone different interests
2. See learning as a joyful gift
3. Appreciate classmates' different strengths

---

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Diversity of Gifts** — God made each person unique with different talents and interests. When we explore different activities, we discover the gifts God gave us!

### Scripture Connection
> "There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them."
> — 1 Corinthians 12:4

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered why some people like building and others like drawing? God gave everyone different interests so we can help each other!"

## 📝 Station Rotation System

### How Stations Work

**Option A: Free Choice**

- Students choose which stations to visit

- Use "passport" to track where they've been

- Must visit at least 2 stations per session

**Option B: Guided Rotation**

- Class divided into 4-5 groups

- Groups rotate every 5-6 minutes at signal

- Everyone visits all stations each week

**Recommended for Kindergarten:** Guided rotation with some free choice time

---

## 📝 Week 19: Introduction & First Rotation

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (25 minutes)

---

### 1. Opening Prayer & Introduction (4 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for giving us so many ways to learn. Help us to discover new things we love and to see Your gifts in ourselves and our friends. Amen."

**Explain Stations:**
> "For the next few weeks, we're going to explore different STREAM stations! Each station has different activities. You'll get to try them all!"

**Tour the stations quickly:**

- "Here's the Building Zone — you can build with KEVA!"

- "Here's Robot Corner — you can drive robots!"

- "Here's Art & Creation — you can draw and make things!"

- "Here's Science Discovery — you can explore and observe!"
