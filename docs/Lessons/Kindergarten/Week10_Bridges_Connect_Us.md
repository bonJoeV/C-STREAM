# Week 10: Bridges Connect Us

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### STEM Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Build a simple bridge using KEVA planks or blocks
2. Understand that bridges connect two places
3. Test if their bridge can hold a small weight
4. Identify parts of a bridge (supports, deck/top)

### Faith Integration Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Understand that bridges connect people just like God's love connects us
2. Recognize that building bridges for others is an act of service
3. Think about how we can "build bridges" of friendship

---

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Solidarity** — God wants us to be connected to each other. Bridges help people get to places they couldn't go before — to schools, hospitals, churches, and to visit family. When we build bridges, we're helping people connect with each other.

### Scripture Connection
> "Love one another as I have loved you."
> — John 15:12

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how people build bridges over rivers and valleys? What would happen if there were no bridges?"

## 📝 Lesson Procedure

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (25 minutes)

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer & Wonder | 3 min | Prayer about connections |
| Introduction to Bridges | 5 min | What is a bridge? |
| Bridge Building Challenge | 12 min | Build and test |
| Sharing & Closing | 5 min | Reflect and pray |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer & Wonder (3 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for connecting us to each other. Help us build bridges today — with blocks and with friendship. Amen."

**Wonder Question:**
> "What would happen if there were no bridges in the world? How would people get across rivers?"

---

### 2. Introduction to Bridges (5 minutes)

**Show pictures of bridges:**
> "This is a bridge. Bridges help people get from one place to another when something is in the way — like a river or a valley."

**Parts of a bridge:**

- "The TOP part where you walk or drive is called the deck"

- "The parts that HOLD IT UP are called supports"

**Make a Connection:**
> "Bridges connect people! They help us get to school, to church, to visit grandma. When people build bridges, they're helping others."

**Faith Connection:**
> "God's love is like a bridge — it connects us to Him and to each other. We can build bridges of friendship by being kind!"

---

### 3. Bridge Building Challenge (12 minutes)

**Present the Challenge:**
> "Your challenge: Build a bridge that goes from this stack of books to that stack of books. It needs to be strong enough for a toy car to cross!"

**Show the gap** (6 inches between two stacks of books or boxes).

**Rules:**

- Use KEVA planks (and cups if desired)

- Bridge must go across the whole gap

- Test it with the toy car

**Building Time:**

- Students work in pairs or small groups

- Teacher circulates asking questions:
  - "How will you make it stay up?"
  - "What if you add more supports?"
  - "Does it reach all the way across?"

**Testing:**
When groups are ready, test with toy car:
> "Let's see if the car can cross safely!"

**If it falls:**
> "Good try! What could you change to make it stronger?"

---

### 4. Sharing & Closing (5 minutes)

**Gallery Walk:**
> "Let's walk around and see everyone's bridges!"

**Discussion:**

- "What was hard about building a bridge?"

- "What made your bridge strong?"

- "Why are bridges important for people?"

**Building Bridges of Friendship:**
> "We can also build bridges with our hearts. When we're kind to someone, when we include someone in a game, when we forgive — we're building bridges of friendship."

**Think-Pair-Share:**
> "Turn to a friend. Tell them one way you can build a bridge of friendship this week."

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for bridges that connect us. Help us build bridges with our hands and with our hearts. Help us to be kind and to connect with everyone. Amen."

## ✅ Assessment

### Observation Checklist
| Skill | Observed |
|-------|----------|
| Built a bridge spanning the gap | ☐ |
| Included supports in design | ☐ |
| Tested bridge with weight | ☐ |
| Discussed why bridges matter | ☐ |
| Connected to friendship bridges | ☐ |

### Success Criteria

- Bridge spans the entire gap

- Student can identify bridge parts (top, supports)

- Student shares one way to build a friendship bridge

---

## 🔄 Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-build supports, have student add the deck

- Partner with a helpful buddy

- Smaller gap to span

- Use larger blocks if KEVA is too challenging

### For Advanced Learners

- Increase the gap width

- Challenge: Use as few planks as possible

- Add weight test: How many cars can it hold?

- Draw your bridge design afterward

---

## 🆘 Substitute Teacher Notes

**Simplified version:**
1. Look at bridge pictures together
2. Free build with KEVA planks
3. Try to build any bridge (with or without testing)
4. Talk about bridges connecting people
5. Prayer

## 📎 Home Connection

**Family Note:**
> "Today we learned about bridges in STREAM class! We built bridges with blocks and talked about how bridges connect people.

Look for bridges when you're driving around town!"
