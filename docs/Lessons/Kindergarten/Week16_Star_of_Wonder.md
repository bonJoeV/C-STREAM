## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Wonder at Creation** — God created the stars and placed them in the sky. He used a special star to lead the Wise Men to baby Jesus. When we look at the stars, we see God's amazing creation.

### Scripture Connection
> "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."
> — Matthew 2:2

### Saint Connection
**The Magi (Three Wise Men)** — These wise men studied the stars and knew that a special star meant something important. They followed it all the way to Bethlehem!

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how many stars are in the sky? God made them all!"

### 1. Opening Prayer & Story (5 minutes)

**Prayer:**

**Tell the Story of the Star (simplified):**
> "A long time ago, when Jesus was born, God put a special star in the sky. Far away, there were Wise Men who studied the stars. They saw this new, bright star and knew it meant something special — a new king was born!

> The Wise Men followed the star for a long time. It led them all the way to Bethlehem, where baby Jesus was. They brought Him special gifts and worshipped Him.

> God used a STAR — something He created in the sky — to lead people to Jesus!"

**Discussion:**

- "What did the star help the Wise Men find?" (Baby Jesus)

- "Who made the stars?" (God)

---

### 2. Star Science (6 minutes)

**What are stars?**
> "Stars are in the sky. We can see them at night when it's dark. They look like tiny lights, but really they're very, very far away and very, very big — even bigger than our Earth!"

**How many stars?**
> "There are SO many stars that we can't even count them all. Only God knows how many!"

**Star Patterns (Constellations):**
> "When you look at the stars, you can find patterns. Long ago, people gave these patterns names. Look at this one — it's called the Big Dipper because it looks like a big spoon!"

Show image of Big Dipper and trace the pattern.

**Simple Activity: Connect the Stars**

- Give each student a "connect the stars" card

- Have them draw lines to connect the star dots

- "You just made a constellation!"

### 3. Star Art Creation (11 minutes)

**Introduce the project:**
> "Now you're going to create your own night sky with stars — just like the sky the Wise Men saw!"

---

### 4. Closing & Wonder (3 minutes)

**Share:**
> "Hold up your star picture! Look at all those beautiful night skies!"

**Wonder moment:**
> "Tonight, when it gets dark, look up at the sky. Can you find any stars? Remember that God made every single one!"

**Faith Connection:**
> "Just like the star led the Wise Men to Jesus, God helps lead US to Jesus too — through our families, our church, and our school. We follow Jesus!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for the beautiful stars. Thank you for leading the Wise Men to Jesus. Help us to always follow Your light and find Jesus in everything. Amen."
