## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gratitude for Gifts** — Everything we can do is a gift from God — our ability to learn, to build, to create, to wonder. When we look back at what we've learned, we thank God for these abilities.

### Scripture Connection
> "Every good and perfect gift is from above."
> — James 1:17

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how much you've grown since the beginning of the year? Look at all you can do now!"

**Section 1: Draw your favorite activity**
> "In the big box, draw your favorite thing we did in STREAM this fall. Was it robots? Building? The Wonder Walk? Drawing your thankful animation?"

(Give 4-5 minutes for drawing)

**Section 2: Circle your feelings**
> "Look at the smiley faces. How do you feel about STREAM class? Circle the face that shows how you feel."

**Section 3: What do you want to learn?**
> "In the second box, draw something you want to learn about next!"

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Tell me about your drawing!"

- "I can see that was your favorite!"

- "What do you want to learn next time?"

---

### 4. Closing Celebration (5 minutes)

**Share time:**
> "Who wants to share their favorite?"

Let 3-4 students share quickly.

**Celebrate growth:**
> "Look at everything you can do now! At the beginning of the year, you didn't know how to drive a robot or build a tower that stands up. Now you can! That's because you kept trying, even when things were hard. God gave you a wonderful brain that can learn new things!"

**Affirmation:**
> "You are all STREAM stars!"

Optional: Give out stickers, stamps, or simple certificates.

**Preview spring:**
> "After winter break, we'll learn even more — more coding, more building, and more adventures! I can't wait!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for this wonderful fall. Thank you for helping us learn and grow. Help us to keep wondering, keep learning, and keep helping others. Amen."
