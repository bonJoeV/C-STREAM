# Weeks 2-3: Exploring Movement with Sphero

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### STEM Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Use Sphero in drive mode to move the robot forward, backward, left, and right
2. Predict where Sphero will go before moving it
3. Use directional vocabulary (forward, backward, left, right)
4. Understand that robots follow instructions from people

### Faith Integration Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Recognize that movement is a gift from God
2. Connect the idea that God gave us the ability to create tools (like robots) to help us

---

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Stewardship of Creation** — God gave humans the special ability to create and invent things. When we program a robot, we are using the creative minds God gave us. We use technology responsibly to help others and care for creation.

### Scripture Connection
> "I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well."
> — Psalm 139:14

### Catholic Scientist Connection
**Father Roberto Busa** — A Catholic priest who helped create one of the first computer databases. He showed that faith and technology can work together!

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how robots know what to do? They can't think like we can — someone has to tell them!"

## 📝 Week 2 Procedure: Meet Sphero

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (25 minutes)

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer & Wonder | 3 min | Prayer and introduction |
| Meet Sphero | 7 min | Demonstration and observation |
| Explore Drive Mode | 10 min | Hands-on exploration |
| Closing & Reflection | 5 min | Discussion and prayer |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer & Wonder Moment (3 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for giving us the ability to make amazing things like robots. Help us to use technology wisely and to learn something new today. Amen."

**Wonder Question:**
> "What do you think this ball can do?" (Hold up Sphero without turning it on)

---

### 2. Meet Sphero (7 minutes)

**Introduction:**
> "This is Sphero! Sphero is a special kind of robot. It can roll, change colors, and do tricks. But here's the important thing — Sphero can't think for itself. WE have to tell it what to do!"

**Demonstration:**
1. Turn on Sphero (show students the light)
2. Connect to iPad using Sphero Edu app
3. Show "Drive" mode
4. Demonstrate moving forward, backward, left, right
5. Let students predict: "Where will it go if I swipe this way?"

**Discussion:**
> "How is Sphero different from us? Can it decide where to go by itself?" (No! We have to tell it.)
> "God gave us brains that can think and make choices. Robots can only do what people tell them."

---

### 3. Explore Drive Mode (10 minutes)

**Setup:**

- Divide into groups of 2-3 students

- Each group gets one Sphero and iPad

- Establish boundaries with tape

**Guided Exploration:**

| Step | Teacher Says | Students Do |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | "Try to make Sphero go forward" | Experiment with swiping |
| 2 | "Now make it go backward" | Reverse direction |
| 3 | "Can you make it turn left?" | Practice turning |
| 4 | "Try to drive it in a circle" | Combine movements |

**Rotate groups** so everyone gets to control Sphero for at least 2 minutes.

**Teacher circulates** asking:

- "Where do you think Sphero will go?"

- "What happens when you swipe fast vs. slow?"

- "Is it going where you want it to go?"

---

### 4. Closing & Reflection (5 minutes)

**Gather on rug. Park Spheros in "charging station."**

**Discussion:**

- "What was hard about driving Sphero?"

- "What was easy?"

- "How did you make Sphero go where you wanted?"

**Connection to Faith:**
> "God gave people the ability to make robots and computers. We use our brains — the brains God gave us — to create things that can help others. That's pretty amazing!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for the gift of creativity. Help us to use technology to do good things. Amen."

## 📝 Week 3 Procedure: Sphero Challenge

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (25 minutes)

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer & Review | 3 min | Prayer and direction review |
| Direction Practice | 5 min | Direction vocabulary |
| Maze Challenge | 12 min | Navigate Sphero through course |
| Closing & Reflection | 5 min | Discussion and prayer |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer & Review (3 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, help us to work together and try our best today. When things get hard, help us to keep trying. Amen."

**Review:**
> "Last week we met Sphero. Who remembers how to make it move forward? Backward? Turn?"

---

### 2. Direction Practice (5 minutes)

**Stand up and practice directions with bodies:**

- "Everyone take one step FORWARD"

- "Take one step BACKWARD"

- "Turn LEFT"

- "Turn RIGHT"

**Show direction cards and have students call out the direction.**

**Connect to Sphero:**
> "These are the same directions we'll give Sphero today!"

---

### 3. Maze Challenge (12 minutes)

**Setup:**

- Simple tape maze on floor (start → straight → turn → end)

- Groups of 2-3 students

- One Sphero per group

**Challenge Instructions:**
> "Your challenge is to drive Sphero from START to FINISH without going outside the lines. You'll have to work together!"

**Rules:**
1. Take turns being the driver
2. Help each other with directions
3. If Sphero goes outside, start over (that's okay!)
4. Cheer for each other

**Teacher support:**

- Prompt: "What direction should you go next?"

- Encourage: "That's okay, try again!"

- Celebrate: "You worked together!"

**If time allows:** Let groups try to beat their own time or create a new challenge.

---

### 4. Closing & Reflection (5 minutes)

**Gather together.**

**Discussion:**

- "What was the hardest part of the maze?"

- "How did your group help each other?"

- "What did you learn about controlling Sphero?"

**Faith Connection:**
> "God gave us the ability to solve problems and work together. When we help each other, we show God's love. You were great teammates today!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for friends who help us learn. Thank you for the gift of movement and for our creative minds. Amen."

## ✅ Assessment

### Observation Checklist
| Skill | Week 2 | Week 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Can make Sphero move forward | ☐ | ☐ |
| Can make Sphero turn | ☐ | ☐ |
| Uses direction vocabulary | ☐ | ☐ |
| Works cooperatively with partner | ☐ | ☐ |
| Makes predictions about movement | ☐ | ☐ |

### Success Criteria

- Student can move Sphero in an intended direction

- Student uses at least 2 direction words (forward, backward, left, right)

- Student participates in group work

---

## 🔄 Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pair with a patient, helpful partner

- Use larger maze boundaries

- Hand-over-hand guidance for iPad swiping

- Focus on one direction at a time

### For Advanced Learners

- Create more complex maze with multiple turns

- Challenge: Make Sphero stop at a specific spot

- Ask: "What would happen if you made it go faster/slower?"

---

## 🆘 Substitute Teacher Notes

**If technology isn't working:**
1. Do "Robot Game" — One student is the "robot," another gives directions
2. Practice directions with bean bag toss
3. Use toy cars to practice maze navigation

**Sphero troubleshooting:**

- If not connecting: Turn Sphero off and on, close and reopen app

- If moving wrong direction: Tap "Aim" and point arrow toward front

## 📖 Vocabulary

| Word | Definition | Visual Cue |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Robot** | A machine that follows instructions | Picture of robot |
| **Forward** | Moving ahead, in front | Arrow pointing up |
| **Backward** | Moving behind, going back | Arrow pointing down |
| **Left** | The side where your heart is | L hand shape |
| **Right** | The other side from left | Point right |
| **Program** | Instructions that tell a robot what to do | List of steps |

---

## 📎 Home Connection

**Family Note:**
> "This week we explored robots in STREAM class! We learned that robots can't think — people have to give them instructions. Ask your child to give YOU directions like a robot. Say 'I'm a robot. Tell me how to walk to the door!' Follow their directions exactly — they'll learn that directions need to be clear and specific!"
