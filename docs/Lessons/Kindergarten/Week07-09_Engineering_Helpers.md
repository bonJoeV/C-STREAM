# Weeks 7-9: Engineering Helpers

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### STEM Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Follow a simple design process: Ask → Imagine → Plan → Create → Test
2. Identify a problem that needs to be solved
3. Create a simple tool or device using provided materials
4. Test their design and identify what works and what could be better

### Faith Integration Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Understand that God wants us to help others
2. Recognize that engineers create things to help people
3. Connect their work to serving others

---

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Option for the Poor and Vulnerable** — God calls us to care especially for people who need help. Engineers design things that make life better for others — wheelchair ramps, hearing aids, safe water systems. Even in kindergarten, we can learn to design things that help.

### Scripture Connection
> "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others."
> — 1 Peter 4:10

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered who invents the things that help people, like glasses or crutches or step stools?"

### 1. Opening Prayer (3 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for all the people who help us every day — doctors, teachers, parents, firefighters. Help us learn how to help others too. Amen."

**Connect:**
> "God wants us to help other people. Today we're going to start thinking like engineers — people who create things to help others!"

---

### 2. Story & Discussion (8 minutes)

**Introduce the Engineering Design Process** using a simple poster:

```
🤔 ASK    - What is the problem?
💭 IMAGINE - What are some ideas?
📝 PLAN   - What will I make?
🔨 CREATE - Build it!
✅ TEST   - Does it work?
```

**Present the Problem (Choose ONE for the class):**

**Option A: The Reaching Problem**
> "Maya is too short to reach the book on the high shelf. She needs something to help her reach it. What could we make?"

**Option B: The Carrying Problem**
> "Grandpa has a hard time carrying his water glass and his book at the same time. What could help him?"

**Option C: The Pet Problem**
> "The classroom pet needs a new toy to play with. What could we create?"

**Discussion Questions:**

- "Who has this problem?"

- "What do they need?"

- "Why would it help them?"

---

### 3. Brainstorming - IMAGINE (9 minutes)

**Group Brainstorm:**
> "Let's think of ideas! There are no wrong ideas in brainstorming!"

**Record ideas** on chart paper with simple drawings.

**Prompt creativity:**

- "What if it was really tall?"

- "What if it had wheels?"

- "What if it had a handle?"

**Partner Share:**
Have students turn to a partner and share their favorite idea.

**Individual Imagination:**
Give each student paper to draw ONE idea for a helper tool.

---

### 4. Closing (5 minutes)

**Share a few ideas:**
> "Who wants to share their idea?"

**Preview next week:**
> "Next week, we'll PLAN our designs and start CREATING! Think about your idea this week."

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for creative minds that can imagine ways to help others. Bless our ideas. Amen."

**Guide students:**
> "Before engineers build, they draw a PLAN. Draw what you want to make. Show the parts it will have."

**Simple Planning Sheet:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MY ENGINEERING PLAN                 │
│ Name: _______________               │
│                                     │
│ My helper tool will help: ______    │
│                                     │
│ [Big box for drawing]               │
│                                     │
│ I will need: _________________      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 4. Closing (3 minutes)

**Status check:**
> "Hold up your helper tool! Is it finished or still in progress?"

**Prepare for next week:**
> "Next week, we'll TEST our designs to see if they work! We might need to make changes."

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for hands that can build. Help our helper tools to work well. Amen."

- "What worked well?"

- "What didn't work?"

**Record Results:**
Students mark on their planning sheet: ✓ It worked! or ✗ Needs changes

---

### 3. Improving (6 minutes)

**Introduce "Improve":**
> "Engineers almost ALWAYS make changes after testing. That's not failing — that's improving!"

**Make one change:**
> "Think of ONE thing you could change to make it better. You have 5 minutes to improve your design."

**Students make modifications with available materials.**

**Quick retest if time allows.**

---

**Gallery Walk or Show and Tell:**
> "Let's celebrate our engineering! Who wants to share?"

**Sharing prompts:**

- "What is your helper tool?"

- "Who does it help?"

- "What's your favorite part?"

**Faith Connection:**
> "You just did what real engineers do! You found a problem, imagined solutions, made a plan, built something, and tested it. God gives us the ability to help others by creating things. You are all helpers!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for helping us create things that help others. Thank you for the patience to keep trying. Help us to always look for ways to help people. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection

**Family Note:**
> "We completed our first engineering project in STREAM! Your child designed and built a 'helper tool' to solve a problem. At home, encourage engineering thinking by asking: 'What's a problem we could solve? What could we make or change to help?' Even building a fort or creating a new way to organize toys uses engineering!"
