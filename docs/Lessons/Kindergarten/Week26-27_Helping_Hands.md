# Weeks 26-27: Helping Hands Engineering

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### STEM Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Identify a problem someone faces
2. Design and create a simple tool to help solve that problem
3. Test their design and explain how it helps
4. Iterate (make changes) based on testing

### Faith Integration Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Connect engineering to caring for others
2. Understand that everyone deserves help and dignity
3. See themselves as helpers in God's world

---

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Dignity of the Human Person** — Every person is valuable and deserves to be treated with respect. Some people need extra help because of age, illness, or disability. Engineers create things to help everyone live with dignity.

### Scripture Connection
> "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ."
> — Galatians 6:2

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati** — This young Catholic man spent his life helping the poor and sick. He used his time and talents to serve others.

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how people in wheelchairs open doors? Or how people who can't see read books? Engineers create tools to help!"

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer | 3 min | Prayer for helpers |
| Who Needs Help? | 7 min | Discussion & cards |
| Choosing a Problem | 5 min | Select a challenge |
| Planning | 8 min | Design planning |
| Closing | 2 min | Preview building |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer (3 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, help us to see people who need help. Give us creative minds to make things that can help them. Help us to be Your hands in the world. Amen."

**Introduction:**
> "Today we're going to be helper engineers! We're going to make something to help someone who has a problem."

---

### 2. Who Needs Help? (7 minutes)

**Show picture cards and discuss:**

| Picture | Discussion |
|---------|------------|
| Grandma with sore hands | "Sometimes older people have hands that hurt. It's hard to open jars or hold things." |
| Child in wheelchair | "Some people use wheelchairs to get around. Sometimes things are hard to reach." |
| Person with cast on arm | "If you hurt your arm, it's hard to do things with one hand." |
| Baby who drops toys | "Babies drop things all the time! And they can't pick them up by themselves." |
| Person who is blind | "Some people can't see. They use their hands and ears to understand the world." |

**Key message:**
> "Everyone needs help sometimes. And everyone deserves to be helped! When engineers make things to help people, they're showing love."

---

### 3. Choosing a Problem (5 minutes)

**Present simplified challenges:**

> "Pick ONE problem you want to help solve:"

| Challenge | Problem | Engineering Solution |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| A | Grandma can't hold her cup with sore hands | Make a cup holder |
| B | Baby keeps dropping toys | Make a toy that attaches |
| C | Someone can't reach things on a shelf | Make a reaching tool |
| D | Someone with one hand can't hold a book open | Make a book holder |

**Students choose** (raise hands or move to corners).

**Group students** by their chosen challenge.

---

### 4. Planning (8 minutes)

**Distribute design sheets.**

**Guide planning:**
> "Before engineers build, they PLAN. Draw what you want to make."

**Planning questions:**

- "Who will this help?"

- "What will it do?"

- "What materials might you need?"

**Students draw their design ideas.**

**Teacher circulates asking:**

- "Tell me about your idea"

- "How will this help the person?"

- "What materials will you use?"

---

### 5. Closing (2 minutes)

**Preview:**
> "Next week we'll BUILD our helping tools!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for creative minds. Help us to make something that will really help someone. Amen."

---

## 📝 Week 27: Building & Testing

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (25 minutes)

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer | 2 min | Prayer |
| Review Plans | 3 min | Remember designs |
| Building Time | 14 min | Create prototypes |
| Testing & Sharing | 6 min | Does it work? |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer (2 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, guide our hands as we build today. Help our creations to really help people. Amen."

---

### 2. Review Plans (3 minutes)

**Return design sheets:**
> "Look at your plan from last week. Remember who you're helping and what you're making!"

**Quick shares:**
> "Who wants to remind us what they're making and who it will help?"

---

### 3. Building Time (14 minutes)

**Materials stations set up around room.**

**Building rules:**

- Get materials you need

- Work at your table

- It's okay to change your plan!

- Ask for help if needed

**Teacher circulates:**

- "How's it going?"

- "Is this working like you planned?"

- "What could you change to make it better?"

**Encourage problem-solving:**
> "If it's not working, that's okay! Try something different."

---

### 4. Testing & Sharing (6 minutes)

**Testing stations:**

- Cup of water for cup holder test

- Book for book holder test

- Small toy for reaching tool test

**Small group testing:**
Students test their designs (does it actually help?).

**Quick improvements:**
> "Does it work? If not, what's one thing you could change?"

Give 2 minutes to make quick adjustments if needed.

**Sharing:**
> "Who wants to show us their helper tool?"

Show 3-4 examples quickly.

**Faith Connection:**
> "You just did what engineers do every day — you saw someone who needed help, and you made something to help them! That's how we can be God's hands in the world. When we use our talents to help others, we're showing God's love."

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for helping us make things to help others. Help us to always look for ways to help people around us. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection

**Family Note:**
> "In STREAM, we became 'helper engineers'! Your child designed and built a tool to help someone with a problem — like a cup holder for someone with sore hands or a reaching tool for someone in a wheelchair. We talked about how God wants us to help others and how engineers create things that help people live with dignity. Ask your child: 'Who did your invention help? How?'"
