## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gratitude** — Giving thanks is an important part of our faith. We thank God for His gifts every time we pray. Using technology to create something that shares our thankfulness is a way to use our gifts to honor God.

### Scripture Connection
> "Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures forever."
> — Psalm 107:1

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how people who live far away can share thankful messages? Technology helps us share our thankfulness with the whole world!"
