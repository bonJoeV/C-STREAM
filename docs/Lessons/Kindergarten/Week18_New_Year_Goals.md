**Celebrate:**
> "Wow! Look at all those things! You learned SO much. And guess what? You're going to learn even more this year!"

**Growth mindset moment:**
> "Remember when something was hard? Like when your tower fell down? But you kept trying! That's how we learn — we keep trying even when it's hard."

---

### 3. Goal Setting (12 minutes)

**Introduce Goals:**
> "A goal is something you want to learn or do. When you set a goal, you try your best to reach it. What are some things you want to learn in STREAM?"

**Brainstorm possible goals:**

> "In the first box, draw something you learned in STREAM this fall."

Give 3-4 minutes.

**Section 2: Something I want to learn (draw)**
> "In the second box, draw something you WANT to learn. What sounds exciting to you? Maybe robots? Building? Coding? Something else?"

Give 3-4 minutes.

**Section 3: My goal (circle and/or draw)**
> "Now pick ONE goal for this year. Circle it or draw it."

Show goal options:

- I will try new things

- I will do my best

---

### 4. Closing & Commitment (5 minutes)

**Partner Share:**
> "Turn to a neighbor and tell them your goal."

**Whole Group Share:**
> "Who wants to share their goal with everyone?"

Let 3-4 students share.

**God Helps Us:**
> "Here's the best part — you don't have to reach your goals all by yourself! God helps us learn and grow. When something is hard, you can ask God to help you. And your teachers and friends will help too!"

**Goal Commitment:**
> "Let's make a promise together. Repeat after me:
> 'I will try my best... (I will try my best)
> I will keep trying when it's hard... (I will keep trying when it's hard)
> I know God will help me grow!' (I know God will help me grow!)"

**Star Sticker:**
Give each student a star sticker for their goal sheet.
> "This star reminds you that God sees you and is cheering for you!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for new beginnings. Help us to reach our goals this year. When we feel like giving up, give us strength to keep trying. Thank you for believing in us. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection

**Family Note:**
> "Today we set STREAM goals for the new year! Your child thought about what they want to learn and made a commitment to keep trying. Talk with your child about their goal. Ask: 'What do you want to learn in STREAM this year?' 

> At home, help your child set other goals too — learning to tie shoes, reading more books, being kind to siblings. Celebrate effort, not just success. When they struggle, remind them: 'You can do hard things with God's help!'"
