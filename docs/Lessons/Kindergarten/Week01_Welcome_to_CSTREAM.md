# Week 1: Welcome to C-STREAM

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### STEM Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Identify what each letter in STREAM stands for
2. Give one example of something they want to learn in STREAM class
3. Understand that asking questions is an important part of science

### Faith Integration Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Recognize that God gave us curious minds to explore the world
2. Understand that learning about creation helps us know God better

---

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Wonder and Curiosity** — God created humans with curious minds that want to understand the world. When we learn about science, technology, engineering, art, and math, we discover more about God's amazing creation.

### Scripture Connection
> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."
> — Psalm 19:1

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how God made so many different things in the world?"

**Hold up each letter card and introduce with a motion:**

| Letter | Stands For | Motion | Example |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|
| **S** | Science | Point to eyes (observe) | "Looking at bugs, plants, and stars" |
| **T** | Technology | Pretend to tap a screen | "iPads and robots that help us" |
| **R** | Religion | Hands folded in prayer | "God made all these amazing things!" |
| **E** | Engineering | Build motion with hands | "Building bridges and towers" |
| **A** | Art | Draw in the air | "Creating beautiful things" |
| **M** | Math | Count on fingers | "Counting, shapes, and patterns" |

**Practice the STREAM chant with motions 2-3 times.**

---

### 3. Main Activity: STREAM Exploration (12 minutes)

#### Part A: Picture Sorting (5 minutes)

**Show picture cards one at a time and ask:**
> "Is this Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, or Math?"

**Sample pictures:**

- Scientist looking at a bug (Science)

- Child using an iPad (Technology)

- Someone building a tower (Engineering)

- Colorful painting (Art)

- Shapes and numbers (Math)

- Church/Cross (Religion - connects to all!)

**Emphasize:** "God made us able to do ALL of these things!"

#### Part B: Wonder Journal First Page (7 minutes)

**Give each student their Wonder Journal.**

**Guide students to:**
1. Draw a picture of themselves as a "STREAM explorer"
2. Draw one thing they want to learn about this year

**Walk around and ask students about their drawings. Affirm their curiosity!**

---

### 4. Closing & Reflection (5 minutes)

**Gather students back on the rug.**

**Discussion Questions:**

- "What is one thing you remember about STREAM?"

**Wonder Wall Introduction:**
> "This is our Wonder Wall. When you have a question about how something works, we can put it here!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for this new year of learning. Help us to be curious explorers who see Your love in everything we discover. Amen."
