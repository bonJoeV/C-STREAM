## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Stewardship of Creation** — God created the world and everything in it. He gave humans the special job of taking care of creation. When we observe nature carefully, we see God's amazing design and learn to appreciate His gifts.

### Scripture Connection
> "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good."
> — Genesis 1:31

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — St. Francis loved all of God's creatures. He called animals his brothers and sisters and saw God's love in every part of creation.

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered why there are so many different kinds of leaves? Or why some flowers smell so nice?"

| Wonder Walk | 15 min | Outdoor exploration |
| Sharing & Closing | 6 min | Share discoveries, prayer |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer & Introduction (4 minutes)

**Gather students before going outside.**

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for the beautiful world You created. Open our eyes to see the wonderful things You made. Help us to notice things we've never seen before. Amen."

**Introduction:**
> "Today we're going on a Wonder Walk! Scientists observe — that means they look carefully at things. We're going to be scientists today and look carefully at God's creation."

**Review expectations:**

- Walk quietly so we can hear nature sounds

- Stay with the group

- Look with your eyes first, touch gently

- Don't pick flowers or hurt anything

**Show recording sheet:**
> "You'll draw 4 things you see. Try to find something that's alive, something that's NOT alive, something small, and something beautiful."

---

### 2. Wonder Walk (15 minutes)

**Lead students outside in a line. Walk slowly.**

**At first stopping point (5 min):**
> "Let's stop here. Look around. What do you notice? What do you see that God made?"

**Guide observations:**

- "Look up — what do you see?"

- "Look down — what's on the ground?"

- "Listen — what do you hear?"

- "Use your magnifying glass — what looks different when it's bigger?"

**First drawing:** Give students 2-3 minutes to draw something they see.

**Continue walking (5 min):**

**Second stopping point:**
> "What's different here? Do you see anything alive?"

**Guide with wonder questions:**

- "I wonder why that leaf has so many lines on it..."

- "I wonder how that ant knows where to go..."

- "I wonder who made that spider web..."

**Second drawing:** Give students 2-3 minutes to draw another observation.

**Final walk and drawings:**
Complete 4 drawings during the walk, stopping at interesting features.

**Wonder Questions to ask:**
| If you see... | Ask... |
|--------------|--------|
| A flower | "I wonder why God made flowers so colorful?" |
| A bug | "I wonder how such a tiny creature knows what to do?" |
| A tree | "I wonder how old this tree is?" |
| Clouds | "I wonder why clouds make different shapes?" |
| A bird | "I wonder how birds know how to build nests?" |

---

### 3. Sharing & Closing (6 minutes)

**Return inside. Gather in a circle.**

**Share discoveries:**
> "Turn to a partner. Show them one thing you drew and tell them about it."

**Whole group sharing:**

- "Who found something alive? What was it?"

- "Who found something NOT alive?"

- "What was the most beautiful thing you saw?"

- "Does anyone have a wonder question about something they saw?"

**Record wonder questions** on the Wonder Wall.

**Faith Connection:**
> "Everything we saw today was made by God! Even the tiniest bug and the biggest tree. God made each thing special and important. We are SO lucky to live in such a beautiful world!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for the beautiful world. Thank you for trees and flowers and bugs and birds. Help us to take care of Your creation. Amen."

**Optional:** Teach the first verse of "All Things Bright and Beautiful"

2. **Nature Table** — Set up items (leaves, pinecones, rocks) for observation
3. **Virtual Walk** — Use nature video/photos to observe
4. **Classroom Plant Study** — Observe classroom plants with magnifying glasses

---

## 📎 Extensions

### Wonder Journal Entry
Have students glue their Wonder Walk sheet into their Wonder Journal and add one sentence (dictated or written): "I wonder..."

### Art Extension

- Create nature rubbings with crayons and leaves

- Make a classroom "Creation Collage" with nature drawings

### Home Connection
**Family Note:**

## 🆘 Substitute Teacher Notes

**Simplified version:**
1. Do opening prayer inside
2. Walk around the building, looking out windows
