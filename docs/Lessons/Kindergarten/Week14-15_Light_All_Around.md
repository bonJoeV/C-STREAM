**Jesus as Light** — During Advent, we light candles as we wait for Jesus, the Light of the World. Just as light helps us see in the dark, Jesus helps us see what is good and true.

### Scripture Connection
> "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness."
> — John 8:12

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered why Advent candles are so important? We light them because Jesus brings light to the world!"
