## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Option for the Poor / Love of Neighbor** — During Advent, we prepare for God's greatest gift — Jesus! One way we can share God's love is by making things for others, especially those who might need extra love or help.

### Scripture Connection
> "For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son."
> — John 3:16

### Saint Connection
**St. Nicholas** — St. Nicholas gave gifts secretly to people who needed help. He showed love through giving. That's why we think of giving at Christmas time!

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered why we give gifts at Christmas? It's because God gave us the best gift ever — Jesus!"

## 📝 Lesson Procedure

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (25 minutes)

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer & Story | 4 min | St. Nicholas & giving |
| Planning | 5 min | Who will you make a gift for? |
| Creating | 13 min | Make your gift |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer & Story (4 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for the gift of Jesus. Help us to share Your love by making something special for someone else today. Amen."

**Tell the story of St. Nicholas (simplified):**
> "Long ago, there was a man named Nicholas. He loved God very much. Nicholas saw people who needed help, and he secretly gave them gifts! He didn't want anyone to know — he just wanted to help. That's why we think of giving at Christmas. We give because God gave us Jesus."

**Connect:**
> "Today, YOU get to be like St. Nicholas! We're going to make gifts or cards for people we love."

---

### 2. Planning: Who Will You Make a Gift For? (5 minutes)

**Think about who:**
> "Think about someone who might really love a gift from you. It could be:
> - Mom, Dad, Grandma, Grandpa
> - A brother or sister
> - A friend
> - Someone who might be lonely or sad"

**Planning Questions:**
> "Once you think of someone, think about:
> - What do they like?
> - What would make them smile?"

**Fill out planning sheet:**
Simple sheet with:

- Who is your gift for? (draw their face or write name)

- What will you make? (card, decoration, bookmark)

- Why? (to say I love you, to make them smile, etc.)

---

### 3. Creating: Make Your Gift (13 minutes)

**Show options:**
> "You can make:
> - A special card with a picture and message
> - A decorated bookmark
> - A paper ornament
> - A picture to frame"

**Show your example:**
> "I made a card for my mom. I drew a picture of us together and wrote 'I love you.' See how I used stickers to decorate?"

**Creating Time:**

- Students select materials

- Work at tables

- Teacher circulates with support and encouragement

**Guiding questions:**

- "Who is this for? That's so thoughtful!"

- "What colors does that person like?"

- "What would make them smile?"

- "Tell me about your picture."

**Encourage love and effort, not perfection:**
> "The best gifts come from your heart. Your person will love it because YOU made it!"

---

### 4. Closing & Reflection (3 minutes)

**Quick share:**
> "Hold up your gift! Who is it for?"

Let a few students share who they made a gift for and why.

**Faith Connection:**
> "When we make something for someone else, we're sharing God's love. Just like God gave us Jesus, we can give our love to others. Your gift will make someone very happy!"

**Instructions for taking home:**
> "You can give this to your special person whenever you want — maybe save it for Christmas!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for helping us make gifts today. Bless the people who will receive these gifts. Help them to feel loved. Amen."
