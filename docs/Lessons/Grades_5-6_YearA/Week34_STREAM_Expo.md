# Week 34: STREAM Expo & Graduation

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Graduation and Sending Forth** — The Mass ends with "Go forth" — a sending into the world. Our STREAM graduation sends students forth equipped with skills, knowledge, and the integration of faith and reason to make a difference.

### Scripture Connection
> "I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus."
> — Philippians 1:6

### Saint Connection
**St. John Paul II** — Called young people to be "not afraid" and to go into the world with faith and reason together. He championed both science and faith, showing they work in harmony.

## End-of-Year Message to Students

**Dear STREAM Engineers, Scientists, and Innovators:**

You did it! You spent this year wondering, building, coding, testing, failing, trying again, and succeeding. You've learned that:


- **Faith and reason go together** — Science and faith aren't enemies; they're partners in understanding truth.

- **Failure is part of learning** — Every engineer fails. The good ones learn from failure.

- **Your gifts are for serving others** — The best STREAM work helps people.

- **You are creative like God** — You're made in the image of the Creator, and you can CREATE!

As you go forward:

- Keep asking "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?"

- Keep making things with your hands and mind

- Keep connecting your learning to your faith

- Keep using your gifts to serve others

You're ready. Go make a difference!

*"The one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it."* — Philippians 1:6
