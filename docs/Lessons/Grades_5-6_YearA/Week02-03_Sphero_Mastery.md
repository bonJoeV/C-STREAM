# Weeks 2-3: Sphero Mastery

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Divine Providence and Free Will** — Robots follow programming exactly. But God gave humans something more: free will. We can CHOOSE. Understanding deterministic systems (robots) helps us appreciate the gift of freedom God gave us.

### Scripture Connection
> "I have set before you life and death, blessing and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live."
> — Deuteronomy 30:19

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — This young tech enthusiast who is on the path to sainthood loved programming and technology. He used his skills to create databases of Eucharistic miracles and other faith resources. Technology, used well, serves God.

# Session 1: Advanced Programming

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Creative God, You made us with the ability to create. As we program today, help us appreciate both the precision of code and the freedom You gave us. May our learning honor You. Amen."

**Mastery mindset:**

- "You've learned Sphero basics — now let's go DEEP"

- "Today: functions, matrix, and compass heading"

- "By the end: autonomous navigation!"

### Advanced Features Deep Dive (15 min)
**Functions:**

- Create reusable blocks of code

- "Write once, use many times"

- Parameters allow customization

**Demo:** Create function "drawSquare" with size parameter

```
Function: drawSquare(size)
  repeat 4 times:
    roll forward at 50 speed for (size) seconds
    turn 90 degrees
```

**Matrix Display (BOLT):**

- 8x8 LED matrix on top of Sphero

- Display patterns, animations, text

- Great for feedback and status

**Demo:** Display happy face when task complete, sad when error

**Compass Heading:**

- 0-359 degrees

- Absolute navigation instead of relative turns

- More precise movement

**Demo:** Program to always head North, regardless of starting orientation

### Guided Practice (15 min)
**Challenge 1: Function Creation**

- Create a function for a triangle

- Create a function for a pentagon

- Create a function with a size parameter

**Challenge 2: Matrix Feedback**

- Display countdown before movement

- Show direction arrows during movement

- Display pattern when task complete

**Challenge 3: Compass Navigation**

- Face North, then move forward

- Face East (90°), move forward

- Navigate a course using compass headings

### Exploration & Closing (10 min)
**Free exploration time:** Combine features creatively.

**Share discoveries:** "What cool thing did you figure out?"

**Faith Connection:** "Sphero does EXACTLY what we program — no more, no less. But God gave us something different: choice. We can choose kindness or cruelty, truth or lies, faith or doubt. That's an incredible gift!"

**Preview:** "Next session: autonomous navigation challenge!"

# Session 2: Autonomous Navigation

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, guide us as we work on navigation today. Just as Sphero uses coordinates to find its way, help us use Your Word to navigate life. Amen."

**Quick review:** Functions, matrix, compass heading.

### Autonomous Challenge Introduction (6 min)
**Challenge:** Program Sphero to navigate a course WITHOUT remote control.

**Course Setup:**

- Start zone

- Multiple waypoints (marked with tape)

- End zone

- Obstacles to avoid

**Requirements:**

- Must start and run automatically

- Must visit all waypoints in order

- Must end in the finish zone

- Use compass headings for accuracy

- Display status on matrix

### Planning Phase (8 min)
**Teams plan navigation:**
1. Map the course (measure distances, angles)
2. Calculate compass headings between waypoints
3. Plan functions for repeated movements
4. Design matrix feedback system

**Math connection:**

- Measure distances in centimeters

- Calculate angles between points

- Convert to speed and time values

### Programming Phase (18 min)
**Teams program and test:**

**Build program incrementally:**
1. First waypoint only → test
2. Add second waypoint → test
3. Continue adding → test each addition
4. Add matrix feedback → test

**Debugging strategies:**

- "What should happen vs. what IS happening?"

- Test small pieces

- Check values and measurements

- Adjust and retry

**Teacher support:**

- Help with mathematical calculations

- Assist with debugging process

- Encourage systematic problem-solving

### Final Runs & Reflection (7 min)
**Each team demonstrates** their autonomous navigation.

**Assessment:**

- Visited all waypoints?

- Ended in finish zone?

- Matrix feedback worked?

- Code organization?

**Reflection discussion:**

- "What was hardest?"

- "How did you debug?"

- "What would you improve?"

### Closing (2 min)
**Faith Connection:** "Autonomous robots follow predetermined paths. But think about your own life: God has a plan for you, but you have CHOICE in following it. Unlike Sphero, you can choose your path. What path will you choose?"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for the gift of free will. Help us choose the paths of life, truth, and love. Guide our steps like a compass guides north. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We explored advanced Sphero programming! Ask your child: 'What are functions in programming?' 'How did you navigate autonomously?' 'What did you learn about debugging?' We also discussed how robots follow programming exactly, but humans have free will to choose our paths. Talk about the gift of choice and how we can choose to follow God."
