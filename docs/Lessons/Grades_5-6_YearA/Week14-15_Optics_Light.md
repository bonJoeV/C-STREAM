# Weeks 14-15: Optics & Light Science

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Light as Theological Symbol** — Light appears throughout Scripture and Catholic tradition as a symbol of God, truth, and salvation. Understanding the physics of light deepens our appreciation of these theological truths.

### Scripture Connection
> "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
> — John 8:12

### Saint Connection
**St. Robert Grosseteste** — 13th-century bishop and scientist who studied optics and light. He believed understanding light was key to understanding the physical world and, through it, understanding God.

# Session 1: Reflection & Refraction

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "God of Light, You created light on the first day of creation. You sent Jesus as the Light of the World. Help us understand the physics of light and see Your truth illuminated through it. Amen."

**Wonder moment:** "Light is the fastest thing in the universe — 186,000 miles per SECOND. Yet we can study it, predict it, and use it. Let's explore how light behaves."

### Reflection Deep Dive (12 min)
**Law of Reflection:**
> Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection

**Key terms:**

- **Incident ray** — Light approaching the mirror

- **Reflected ray** — Light bouncing off

- **Normal line** — Perpendicular to surface

- **Angle of incidence** — Angle between incident ray and normal

- **Angle of reflection** — Angle between reflected ray and normal

**Demonstration:**
1. Shine light at mirror
2. Measure angles
3. Verify: always equal!

**Types of mirrors:**

- **Plane mirror:** Flat, virtual image, same size

- **Concave mirror:** Curves inward, can magnify, real or virtual image

- **Convex mirror:** Curves outward, always smaller virtual image, wider view

**Real applications:**

- Car mirrors (convex for wide view)

- Makeup mirrors (concave for magnification)

- Telescope mirrors (concave to gather light)

**Activity:** Ray tracing with plane mirrors — predict and verify reflection angles.

### Refraction Exploration (13 min)
**What is refraction?**

- Light bends when changing medium

- Different media = different speeds

- Speed change causes direction change

**Snell's Law (conceptual):**

- Light bends TOWARD normal when slowing down (air → water)

- Light bends AWAY from normal when speeding up (water → air)

**Demonstration:**
1. Pencil in water appears bent
2. Light through prism separates colors
3. Light through different lenses

**Lenses:**

- **Convex (converging):** Thicker in middle, brings light together

- **Concave (diverging):** Thinner in middle, spreads light apart

**Real applications:**

- Eyeglasses

- Cameras

- Microscopes

- Telescopes

**Activity:** Refraction observations — document light behavior through water and lenses.

### Faith-Science Connection (5 min)
**Light symbolism in Scripture:**

- "Let there be light" — First act of creation

- "Light of the World" — Jesus's identity

- "Arise, shine, for your light has come" — Isaiah's prophecy

**Connection:** "Light REVEALS. Physical light lets us see. Jesus, as Light of the World, reveals truth, exposes sin, guides our path. The physics of light helps us understand these metaphors more deeply!"

**St. Robert Grosseteste:** "He believed light was the first form of matter, the basis of all physical reality. His studies of optics were acts of worship, seeking to understand God's creation."

### Preview (2 min)
"Next session: We'll build optical devices and apply what we've learned!"

# Session 2: Optical Engineering

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, help us apply our understanding of light to create useful things. May our engineering be an act of worship and service. Amen."

**Quick review:**

- What's the law of reflection?

- What causes refraction?

- Convex vs. concave lenses?

### Optical Device Engineering (8 min)
**Challenge introduction:**

**Option A: Periscope**

- Uses mirrors to see over/around obstacles

- Two plane mirrors at 45° angles

- Application: Submarines, parades, trenches

**Option B: Simple Telescope**

- Uses two convex lenses

- Objective lens gathers light

- Eyepiece lens magnifies

- Application: Astronomy, nature observation

**Option C: Camera Obscura**

- Pinhole projects inverted image

- Basis of all photography

- Application: Understanding how cameras work

**Option D: Kaleidoscope**

- Multiple mirrors create patterns

- Reflection creates symmetry

- Application: Art, understanding reflection angles

**Design requirements:**
1. Understand the optics involved
2. Diagram the light path
3. Build functional device
4. Explain how it works scientifically

### Design & Diagram (8 min)
**Planning:**

- Choose your device

- Research/review how it works

- Draw ray diagram showing light path

- Plan construction

**Ray diagram requirements:**

- Show incident and reflected/refracted rays

- Label mirrors and/or lenses

- Indicate angles where relevant

- Show image formation

### Construction (18 min)
**Build time!**

**Station materials available:**

- Mirrors and mirror holders

- Lenses

- Cardboard tubes

- Tape and glue

- Cardboard for construction

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Explain the ray path in your device"

- "What happens if you change this angle?"

- "Where is the image formed?"

**Troubleshooting guidance:**

- Not working? Check alignment

- Image blurry? Adjust lens position

- Dim? Check for light leaks

### Testing & Demonstration (5 min)
**Test your device:**

- Does it work as expected?

- Can you explain the optics?

- What would improve it?

**Peer demonstrations:**

- Show your device

- Explain the science

- Let others try it

### Closing Reflection (2 min)
**Optical engineering applications:**

- Medical imaging

- Communications (fiber optics)

- Photography and film

- Astronomy

- Microscopy

**Faith Connection:** "St. Robert Grosseteste saw studying light as a spiritual practice. When we understand how light works, we understand more of God's creation. And when we think about Jesus as Light of the World — light that REVEALS, light that GUIDES, light that gives LIFE — the physics gives the metaphor more power!"

**Closing Prayer:** "God of Light, thank You for the beauty and order in how light works. Thank You for scientists who helped us understand it and engineers who apply it. Help us be light to others, reflecting Your love and truth. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We explored advanced light science and built optical devices! Ask your child: 'What's the law of reflection?' 'Why does light bend in water?' 'How does your optical device work?' We connected physical light to Jesus as Light of the World. Look for optics in daily life — glasses, mirrors, cameras. How does understanding light help us appreciate Scripture's light imagery?"
