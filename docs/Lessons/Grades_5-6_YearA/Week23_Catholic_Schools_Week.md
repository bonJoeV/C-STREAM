# Week 23: Catholic Schools Week Engineering

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Servant Leadership** — Jesus modeled servant leadership: "Whoever wants to be great must be servant of all." Leading younger students in STREAM activities is an act of service that develops leadership while helping others.

### Scripture Connection
> "Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity."
> — 1 Timothy 4:12

### Saint Connection
**St. John Bosco** — Patron of youth who pioneered engaging educational methods. He met young people where they were and used play, activity, and hands-on learning to teach both academics and faith.

'What did you learn about teaching?' We discussed servant leadership — leading by serving others. How does your child show leadership at home?"
