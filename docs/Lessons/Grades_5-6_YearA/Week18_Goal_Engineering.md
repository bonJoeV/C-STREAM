## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Discernment and Direction** — The Church encourages prayerful discernment about our path in life. While God has a plan, we cooperate through intentional choices. Goal-setting is a way to steward our time and talents responsibly.

### Scripture Connection
> "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
> — Jeremiah 29:11

### Saint Connection
**St. Ignatius of Loyola** — Developed the Spiritual Exercises, a systematic approach to discernment and spiritual growth. He modeled intentional, goal-oriented spiritual development.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Reflection (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, You have a plan for each of us. Help us set goals that align with Your will. Give us wisdom to plan well and perseverance to follow through. May this new year bring growth in every area of our lives. Amen."

**New Year reflection:**

- "What are you proud of from last year?"

- "What do you want to be different this year?"

- "Where do you sense God calling you to grow?"

### SMART Goals Deep Dive (10 min)
**SMART Framework:**

| Letter | Meaning | Question |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **S** | Specific | What exactly do I want to accomplish? |
| **M** | Measurable | How will I track progress? What numbers? |
| **A** | Achievable | Is this realistic given my resources? |
| **R** | Relevant | Does this matter to me? Does it align with my values? |
| **T** | Time-bound | When will I complete this? What are deadlines? |

**Example transformation:**

❌ **Vague:** "I want to be better at math."
✅ **SMART:** "I will improve my math grade from B- to B+ by May by completing all homework, attending tutoring twice weekly, and practicing 20 minutes daily."

❌ **Vague:** "I want to pray more."
✅ **SMART:** "I will pray for 10 minutes every morning before school for the next semester, using the Examen prayer method."

**Practice together:**
Transform: "I want to be healthier" → SMART version

### Project Planning (10 min)
**Breaking down goals:**

**For your most important goal:**

**1. Identify milestones:**

- What are the major checkpoints?

- Example: "Improve math grade" → (1) Complete all homework this month (2) Attend tutoring for 4 weeks (3) First quiz improvement (4) Mid-term grade check (5) Final grade

**2. Create timeline:**

- Map milestones on calendar

- Identify key dates

- Build in buffer time

**3. Identify dependencies:**

- What needs to happen first?

- What resources do you need?

- Who can help?

**4. Tracking system:**

- How will you monitor progress?

- Weekly check-ins?

- Data to collect?

**Create simple Gantt-style chart for one goal.**

### Accountability & Closing (5 min)
**Accountability structures:**

- Who will hold you accountable?

- When will you check progress?

- What happens if you fall behind?

**Faith Connection:** "St. Ignatius developed a systematic approach to spiritual growth — the Spiritual Exercises aren't random; they're carefully planned. God gives us the ability to plan, to set goals, to pursue growth intentionally. That's not unspiritual — it's good stewardship of our time and talents!"

**Commitment:**

- Choose your #1 goal

- Identify your accountability partner

- Set your first milestone date

**Closing Prayer:** "Lord, bless these goals we've set. Help us pursue them with perseverance, adjust them with wisdom, and remember that all our plans are under Your greater plan. May this year be one of growth — academically, physically, relationally, and spiritually. Amen."
