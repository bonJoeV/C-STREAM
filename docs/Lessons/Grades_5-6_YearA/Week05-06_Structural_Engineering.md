# Weeks 5-6: Structural Engineering

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**The Church as Living Stones** — St. Peter describes Christians as "living stones" being built into a spiritual house. Just as physical structures need every piece in the right place, the Church needs every member contributing their gifts.

### Scripture Connection
> "You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood."
> — 1 Peter 2:5

### Saint Connection
**Medieval Cathedral Builders** — The great Gothic cathedrals were engineering marvels built as acts of worship. Engineers and craftsmen worked for generations to create structures that lifted hearts to God.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- KEVA planks (300+)

- Straws and connectors

- Testing weights (standardized)

- Scale for weighing structures

# Session 1: Forces & Structural Elements

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, You are the foundation and cornerstone of our lives. Help us understand how structures stand strong and how we, as living stones, can build Your kingdom. Amen."

**Wonder moment:** Show images of impressive structures:

- Notre Dame Cathedral

- Golden Gate Bridge  

- Burj Khalifa

**Question:** "How do these structures stand? What keeps them from falling?"

### Forces in Structures (12 min)
**Three main forces:**

**1. Compression** 💀

- Squeezing force

- Pushes inward

- Think: standing on a pillar

- Example: Columns, arches

**2. Tension** ↔️

- Stretching force

- Pulls outward

- Think: pulling a rope

- Example: Cables, ties

**3. Shear** ↕️↕️

- Sliding force

- Forces moving past each other

- Think: scissors cutting

- Example: Bolts, connections

**Demonstration:**

- Show compression by pressing on eraser

- Show tension by stretching rubber band

- Show shear by sliding books past each other

### Structural Elements (10 min)
**Key structural elements:**

**Beams** — Horizontal members spanning between supports

- Resist bending (compression on top, tension on bottom)

**Columns** — Vertical members carrying weight down

- Resist compression

**Trusses** — Triangular arrangements

- Triangles are STRONG (can't deform like squares)

- Distribute forces efficiently

**Arches** — Curved elements pushing outward

- Convert vertical load to horizontal thrust

- Very efficient for compression

**Gothic cathedral engineering:**

- Flying buttresses handle outward thrust

- Pointed arches distribute weight

- Ribbed vaults span large spaces

**Faith connection:** "Cathedral builders solved incredible engineering challenges so they could create spaces that lifted hearts to God. Their science was an act of worship!"

### Guided Exploration (15 min)
**Mini-challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Triangle vs. Square**

- Build a triangle from straws

- Build a square from straws

- Press down — which deforms? Which holds?

**Challenge 2: Beam Study**

- Span a beam (ruler or plank) between two supports

- Add weight to middle

- What happens? Why?

**Challenge 3: Truss Power**

- Add diagonal support to the square

- Test again — what changed?

### Closing & Preview (3 min)
**Faith Connection:** "St. Peter calls us 'living stones.' Each stone in a cathedral has a purpose. Each of us has a purpose in God's kingdom. What's YOUR structural role?"

**Preview:** "Next session: design and build for maximum efficiency!"

# Session 2: Optimization Challenge

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, help us build wisely today — both physical structures and our lives. May everything we create honor You. Amen."

**Quick review:** "What are the three forces? Why are triangles strong?"

### Efficiency Challenge Introduction (6 min)
**Challenge:** Build the most EFFICIENT structure.

**Efficiency = Weight Held ÷ Structure Weight**

**Example:**

- Structure A: Weighs 50g, holds 500g → Efficiency = 10

- Structure B: Weighs 100g, holds 800g → Efficiency = 8

- Structure A is MORE EFFICIENT!

**Constraints:**

- Must span a 12" gap

- Must hold weight at center

- KEVA planks only (counted and weighed)

- 10 minutes build time

**Strategy discussion:**

- "Use FEWER materials wisely, not MORE materials wastefully"

- "Where do you need strength? Where can you save?"

- "Triangles, trusses, strategic placement"

### Design Phase (5 min)
**Quick planning:**

- Sketch your design

- Mark where forces will flow

- Identify structural elements used

- Estimate materials needed

### Build Phase (15 min)
**Construction time!**

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Where are the compression members?"

- "Where are the tension members?"

- "How are you using triangles?"

- "Where could you remove unnecessary material?"

**Encourage strategic thinking:**

- Every piece should have a purpose

- Test as you build

- Be willing to redesign

### Testing & Analysis (12 min)
**Test each structure:**
1. Weigh structure (record)
2. Place across gap
3. Add weight gradually until failure (record max)
4. Calculate efficiency ratio

**Class data collection:**

| Team | Structure Weight | Weight Held | Efficiency |
|------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| A    | 45g              | 600g        | 13.3       |
| B    | 60g              | 720g        | 12.0       |
| ...  | ...              | ...         | ...        |

**Analysis discussion:**

- "Which was most efficient? Why?"

- "What design choices led to efficiency?"

- "What would you do differently?"

### Reflection & Closing (3 min)
**Engineering principles learned:**

- Triangles distribute force

- Efficiency matters

- Design with purpose

**Faith Connection:** "In God's kingdom, every person matters. Like an efficient structure where every piece has purpose, the Church needs every member. You're not extra or unnecessary — you're a 'living stone' with an irreplaceable role!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for the gift of engineering. Help us build structures that serve others and build Your kingdom with our lives. May we each fulfill our purpose as living stones. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We studied structural engineering! Ask your child: 'What are the three forces in structures?' 'Why are triangles strong?' 'What's efficiency in engineering?' Notice structures around you — bridges, buildings, furniture. Discuss how we're called to be 'living stones' in God's kingdom, each with a purpose."
