# Weeks 26-27: Little Bits & Electronics

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**The Body of Christ** — St. Paul describes the Church as a body with many parts, each necessary. Electronic circuits work similarly: every component matters, and they only work when connected properly. We need each other.

### Scripture Connection
> "Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ."
> — 1 Corinthians 12:12

### Saint Connection
**Bl. Carlo Acutis** — Young man who used technology for evangelization. He built websites documenting Eucharistic miracles. He showed that technology can be a tool for faith, not a distraction from it.

# Session 1: Circuit Fundamentals & Exploration

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, You created the physical laws that make electronics possible. Help us understand circuits and use technology to serve others. May we be like Bl. Carlo Acutis, using tech for good. Amen."

**Electronics context:**

- "Every device you use has circuits inside"

- "Understanding circuits = understanding the modern world"

- "And you can CREATE with this knowledge!"

### Circuit Fundamentals (12 min)
**What is a circuit?**

- A complete path for electricity to flow

- Needs: power source, path, load (something that uses power)

- "Circuit" = "circle" — electricity must complete the loop

**Key concepts:**

**Voltage (V):**

- "Push" of electricity

- Like water pressure

- Measured in volts

**Current (I):**

- "Flow" of electricity

- Like water amount

- Measured in amps

**Resistance (R):**

- Opposition to flow

- Like a narrow pipe

- Measured in ohms

**Ohm's Law:** V = I × R
(Voltage = Current × Resistance)

**Little Bits color system:**

- **Blue** = Power (battery, USB)

- **Pink** = Input (buttons, sensors)

- **Green** = Output (lights, motors, sound)

- **Orange** = Wire (extensions, connections)

### Guided Exploration (15 min)
**Circuit building sequence:**

**Circuit 1: Basic**
Power → Light

- Simplest circuit

- What happens when you disconnect? (Circuit broken!)

**Circuit 2: Add Input**
Power → Button → Light

- Input controls flow

- What happens when you press? Release?

**Circuit 3: Multiple Outputs**
Power → Button → Light + Buzzer (split)

- One input, multiple outputs

- Parallel connection

**Circuit 4: Sequential**
Power → Dimmer → Light

- Continuous input control

- How does adjusting affect output?

**Circuit 5: Sensor Input**
Power → Light Sensor → Light

- Automatic input

- What happens in dark? Light?

**Discussion:**

- "What do you notice about how these work?"

- "What happens if you change the order?"

- "What would happen if...?"

### Design Challenge Introduction (10 min)
**Challenge:** Design a circuit that solves a problem or helps someone.

**Examples:**

- **Nightlight:** Light sensor → LED (automatic when dark)

- **Doorbell:** Button → Buzzer (alerts when pressed)

- **Motion alarm:** Motion sensor → Buzzer (security)

- **Mood lamp:** Dimmer → RGB LED (adjustable lighting)

- **Helper for elderly/disabled:** Something that assists with a task

**Requirements:**

- At least one input

- At least one output

- Clear purpose that serves someone

- Faith connection

**Begin planning:**

- Who does this help?

- What's the circuit design?

- How will it be housed/presented?

### Closing (3 min)
**Faith Connection:** "St. Paul says we're like a body — each part matters. In your circuits, every component matters. If you remove the power, nothing works. If you remove the button, you can't control it. We NEED each other. That's how God designed the Church!"

**Preview:** "Next session: complete your project!"

# Session 2: Project Development & Presentation

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (3 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, help us create meaningful projects today. May our electronics serve others and bring You glory. Amen."

**Quick review:** "What's your project? Who does it help?"

### Circuit Building (25 min)
**Project development:**

- Build your circuit

- Test functionality

- Troubleshoot issues

- Create housing/presentation

**Teacher circulates:**

- Help with troubleshooting

- Ask about design decisions

- Connect to faith elements

**Troubleshooting guide:**

- Not working? Check all connections

- Check power source

- Verify correct order (pink between blue and green)

- Test each component individually

**Housing options:**

- Cardboard enclosures

- 3D printed cases (if available)

- Repurposed containers

- Creative solutions

### Documentation (5 min)
**Project documentation:**
1. Circuit diagram (draw your setup)
2. Purpose statement (who does this help?)
3. How it works (explain each component's role)
4. Faith connection (how does this relate to faith?)

### Presentations (10 min)
**Share projects:**

- Demonstrate your circuit

- Explain who it helps

- Describe how it works

- Share faith connection

**Peer feedback:**

- What works well?

- Creative applications?

- Suggestions for improvement?

### Closing Reflection (2 min)
**Bl. Carlo Acutis reflection:**

- "He used technology for evangelization"

- "Built websites about Eucharistic miracles"

- "Died at 15, but made a huge impact with tech"

- "Technology is a TOOL — use it for good!"

**Final faith connection:** "Your circuits show how parts work together. The Church works the same way. Each of us has a role. Connected to each other and to Christ (our power source!), we can do amazing things."

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for the gift of technology. Help us use it wisely to serve others. May we be like Bl. Carlo Acutis, using our tech skills for Your kingdom. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We learned electronics with Little Bits! Ask your child: 'What does voltage, current, and resistance mean?' 'What did you build?' 'Who does your project help?' We learned about Bl. Carlo Acutis, who used technology to spread faith. Discuss as a family: How can we use technology for good?"
