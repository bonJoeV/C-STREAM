# Weeks 29-31: Environmental Science & Stewardship

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Laudato Si'** — Pope Francis's encyclical on care for our common home emphasizes that environmental protection is a moral obligation. The poor suffer most from environmental degradation, connecting care for creation to social justice.

### Scripture Connection
> "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."
> — Genesis 2:15

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — Patron saint of ecology who saw all creation as family. His "Canticle of the Creatures" praised Brother Sun, Sister Moon, and all creation as reflections of God's goodness.

# Session 1: Environmental Data Collection

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer (from Laudato Si'):** "All-powerful God, you are present in the whole universe and in the smallest of your creatures. Embrace with your tenderness all that exists. Pour out upon us the power of your love, that we may protect life and beauty. Amen."

**Laudato Si' context:**

- "Pope Francis calls us to care for our 'common home'"

- "Environmental problems disproportionately hurt the poor"

- "Care for creation IS Catholic Social Teaching"

- "Good science helps us understand what's happening"

### Scientific Methodology Review (8 min)
**The scientific method for environmental study:**
1. **Observe** — What do we notice about our environment?
2. **Question** — What do we want to understand?
3. **Hypothesize** — What do we think is happening?
4. **Experiment/Collect Data** — Gather evidence
5. **Analyze** — What does the data tell us?
6. **Conclude** — What did we learn?
7. **Communicate** — Share findings
8. **Act** — What should we do?

**Environmental questions we might investigate:**

- How does air quality vary in different areas?

- Where is there more/less green space?

- How does water quality compare?

- What's the temperature variation (urban heat island)?

- Where is litter/pollution concentrated?

### Data Collection Planning (10 min)
**Choose investigation focus:**

**Option A: Temperature Study**

- Measure temperature in different locations

- Compare: parking lot vs. grass, sun vs. shade, etc.

- Question: Urban heat island effect?

**Option B: Water Quality**

- Test pH of different water sources

- Compare: tap water, rainwater, puddles

- Question: What affects water quality?

**Option C: Green Space Analysis**

- Map green space around school/neighborhood

- Calculate percentage of area

- Question: Who has access to nature?

**Option D: Waste Audit**

- Categorize school waste

- Calculate percentages by type

- Question: How could we reduce waste?

**Plan your investigation:**

- What exactly will you measure?

- How will you ensure accuracy?

- What variables must you control?

- How will you record data?

### Data Collection (18 min)
**Collect environmental data:**

- Use appropriate tools

- Record precisely

- Note observations

- Multiple measurements for accuracy

**Data recording standards:**

- Time and location

- Exact measurements

- Conditions/context

- Observer name

### Closing (4 min)
**Initial observations:**

- What are you noticing?

- Any surprises?

- What questions are emerging?

**Preview:** "Next session: analyze data and create visualizations!"

# Session 2: Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, help us see clearly what the data reveals. Give us wisdom to understand and courage to act. Amen."

**Data review:** "What did you collect? What do you notice initially?"

### Data Organization (8 min)
**Enter data into spreadsheet:**

- Create clear columns

- Label precisely

- Check for errors

- Calculate basic statistics (mean, range)

**Example organization:**
| Location | Temperature (°F) | Surface Type | Time | Notes |
|----------|------------------|--------------|------|-------|
| Parking lot | 95 | Asphalt | 2pm | Full sun |
| Grass field | 82 | Grass | 2pm | Full sun |
| Under tree | 78 | Grass/shade | 2pm | Shaded |

### Data Visualization (15 min)
**Create meaningful visualizations:**

**Chart types and when to use:**

- **Bar chart:** Comparing categories

- **Line graph:** Changes over time

- **Pie chart:** Parts of a whole

- **Scatter plot:** Relationship between variables

- **Map visualization:** Geographic patterns

**Visualization requirements:**

- Clear title

- Labeled axes

- Key/legend if needed

- Source data noted

**Create at least TWO visualizations of your data.**

### Analysis & Interpretation (12 min)
**Analyze your findings:**

**Questions to answer:**
1. What patterns do you see?
2. Does the data support your hypothesis?
3. What surprised you?
4. What additional data would help?
5. What's the environmental significance?

**Justice analysis:**

- Who is most affected by this environmental factor?

- Are impacts distributed fairly?

- How does this connect to Catholic Social Teaching?

**Laudato Si' connection:**
> "We are not faced with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather one complex crisis which is both social and environmental." (LS 139)

### Closing (6 min)
**Share preliminary findings:**

- What does your data show?

- What visualizations help communicate this?

- What's the social justice connection?

**Preview:** "Next session: develop action plans!"

# Session 3: Action Planning & Presentation

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (3 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, help us move from understanding to action. Give us creativity to imagine solutions and courage to pursue them. Amen."

### Solution Brainstorming (10 min)
**Based on your findings, what should be done?**

**Categories of action:**

**Awareness/Education:**

- Inform others about the issue

- Create educational materials

- Present findings to decision-makers

**Behavior Change:**

- Personal changes we can make

- Encouraging others to change

- Creating reminders/systems

**Physical/Environmental:**

- Direct intervention

- Habitat improvement

- Infrastructure changes

**Policy/Systemic:**

- Advocating for policy changes

- Working with school/community leaders

- Long-term systemic solutions

**Brainstorm across categories:**

- What can we do RIGHT NOW?

- What needs adult help?

- What would make the biggest impact?

### Action Plan Development (12 min)
**Create specific action plan:**

**Template:**
1. **Issue:** What problem did you identify?
2. **Evidence:** What does your data show?
3. **Goal:** What change do you want to see?
4. **Actions:** Specific steps (who, what, when)
5. **Metrics:** How will you measure success?
6. **Faith Connection:** How is this Catholic response?

**Example:**

- **Issue:** Significant temperature difference between paved and green areas

- **Evidence:** 15°F difference between parking lot and grass

- **Goal:** Increase shade and green space near outdoor eating area

- **Actions:** Present data to principal, research plants that provide shade, organize student petition

- **Metrics:** Temperature re-measurement, green space percentage

- **Faith Connection:** Care for creation (Laudato Si'), preferential option for poor (those without AC suffer most in heat)

### Presentations (15 min)
**Share findings and action plans:**

- Present data and visualizations

- Explain analysis

- Propose action plan

- Make Catholic connection

**Audience feedback:**

- What's compelling about this?

- What questions do you have?

- How can we support this action?

### Commitment & Closing (5 min)
**Class commitment:**

- What action(s) will we actually pursue?

- Who will lead what?

- When will we check progress?

**Final faith connection:** "Pope Francis reminds us that care for creation is not optional — it's part of our faith. Today you've used science to understand, and now you're called to act. That's faith and reason working together!"

**Closing Prayer (from Laudato Si'):** "Teach us to discover the worth of each thing, to be filled with awe and contemplation, to recognize that we are profoundly united with every creature as we journey towards your infinite light. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We completed an environmental science project! Ask your child: 'What environmental issue did you study?' 'What did your data show?' 'What action are you planning?' We connected this to Pope Francis's Laudato Si'. As a family, read part of this encyclical (available online) and discuss: What can your family do to care for our common home?"
