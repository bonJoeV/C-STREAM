# Week 28: Pi Day Mathematics

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Mathematical Truth** — Catholics believe mathematical truths are discovered, not invented. Pi exists whether or not humans know about it. This reflects God's ordered creation — truth exists objectively, and we discover it.

### Scripture Connection
> "He has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and with the span of his hand marked off the heavens."
> — Isaiah 40:12

### Saint Connection
**Fr. Marin Mersenne** — 17th-century priest who made significant contributions to mathematics and music theory. He corresponded with Descartes, Pascal, and other great mathematicians, seeing no conflict between faith and mathematical inquiry.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "God of infinite wisdom, Your creation contains beautiful mathematical truths. Help us explore the mystery of pi today and see Your order in mathematics. Amen."

**Pi Day context (March 14 = 3/14):**

- "Pi appears EVERYWHERE in creation"

- "Not just circles — physics, probability, nature"

- "It's irrational — infinite non-repeating digits"

- "Yet it's constant — always exactly the same"

**Wonder:** "How can something be infinite yet constant? How can we know it precisely yet never write it completely?"

### Measuring Pi (10 min)
**Original discovery method:**

- Pi = Circumference ÷ Diameter

- EVERY circle, EVERY size, SAME ratio!

**Activity:**
1. Measure circumference of circular object (string method)
2. Measure diameter
3. Calculate ratio
4. Compare to actual pi (3.14159...)

**Class data collection:**

| Object | Circumference | Diameter | C/D Ratio |
|--------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Can    | 25.1 cm       | 8.0 cm   | 3.14      |
| Lid    | 18.9 cm       | 6.0 cm   | 3.15      |

**Discussion:**

- Why don't we get exactly 3.14159?

- How could we be more precise?

- What does "irrational" mean?

### Monte Carlo Estimation (15 min)
**Visual approach to pi:**

Imagine a square with a circle inside it (circle touches all sides).

- Drop random points in the square

- Count how many land inside the circle

- The ratio relates to pi!

**The math:**

- Square area = (2r)² = 4r²

- Circle area = πr²

- Ratio: Circle/Square = πr²/4r² = π/4

- So: π = 4 × (points in circle / total points)

**Scratch implementation:**
```
Set [in_circle] to 0
Set [total] to 0
Repeat 1000
    Set [x] to (pick random -100 to 100)
    Set [y] to (pick random -100 to 100)
    Set [distance] to (sqrt of ((x * x) + (y * y)))
    If distance < 100 then
        Change [in_circle] by 1
    Change [total] by 1
Set [pi_estimate] to (4 * (in_circle / total))
Say (join "Pi ≈ " (pi_estimate))
```

**Students code and run simulation:**

- Try with 100 points

- Try with 1000 points

- Try with 10000 points

- What happens as you increase points?

**Key insight:** "More samples = closer to true pi! This is called Monte Carlo simulation."

### Pi in the Real World (8 min)
**Where pi appears:**

**Circles and spheres (obvious):**

- Wheels, balls, planets

- Area = πr², Circumference = 2πr

**Waves and oscillation:**

- Sound waves, light waves

- Pendulum motion

- Electronics signals

**Probability and statistics:**

- Normal distribution (bell curve)

- Random walks

**Physics:**

- Einstein's field equations

- Heisenberg uncertainty principle

- Period of pendulum

**Nature:**

- River meandering ratio ≈ π

- Spiral patterns

- Eye structure

**Engineering application:**

- Calculate gear circumference for robot

- Determine wheel rotation for Sphero distance

### Faith Connection (5 min)
**Mathematical constants and God:**

**Pi is discovered, not invented:**

- "Pi existed before humans calculated it"

- "We DISCOVER mathematical truth, we don't CREATE it"

- "This is how Catholics understand all truth — it exists objectively"

**Infinity of pi's digits:**

- "Pi has infinite decimal places, never repeating"

- "We can calculate more digits, but never ALL digits"

- "God is infinite — we can always know Him more, but never comprehend Him fully"

- "Pi reminds us of infinity!"

**Fr. Mersenne reflection:** "Catholic priests and scientists have contributed to mathematics for centuries. They saw discovering mathematical truth as discovering God's creation."

### Closing (2 min)
**Pi celebration:**

- Share estimation results

- How close did simulations get?

- Appreciate the beauty of mathematics

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for mathematical beauty. Thank You that pi is constant throughout the universe — from atoms to galaxies. Help us see Your fingerprints in mathematics and pursue truth in all areas. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We celebrated Pi Day (3/14)! Ask your child: 'What IS pi?' 'How did you estimate it?' 'Where does pi appear in the real world?' We discussed how mathematical truths are DISCOVERED, not invented — they exist whether or not humans know them. This reflects Catholic understanding that truth is objective, created by God."
