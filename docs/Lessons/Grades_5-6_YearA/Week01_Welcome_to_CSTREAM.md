# Week 1: Welcome to C-STREAM

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Faith and Reason as Wings** — Pope St. John Paul II wrote in "Fides et Ratio" that faith and reason are "like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth." As upper-grade students, you become witnesses to this harmony.

### Scripture Connection
> "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."
> — Romans 12:2

### Saint Connection
**St. Thomas Aquinas** — The great Catholic philosopher and theologian who integrated faith and reason in his work. He proved that rigorous thinking leads to, not away from, God.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (6 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, You gave us minds to seek truth and hearts to seek You. As we begin this year of C-STREAM, unite our learning and our faith. Make us leaders who show others that knowing You and knowing Your creation go together. Transform our minds. Amen."

**Upper-Grade Welcome:**

- "You're the senior STREAM students in our school"

- "This year, you'll lead, create, and mentor"

- "Let's make this year extraordinary!"

### Faith and Reason Deep Dive (12 min)
**Explore the relationship:**

**Key teaching:** Faith and reason are NOT enemies!

- Some people think you have to choose — that's FALSE

- The Catholic Church has ALWAYS supported science

- Many great scientists were (and are) people of faith

**Pope St. John Paul II's insight:**
> "Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth."

**Discussion:**

- "What does this mean?"

- "How can faith HELP science?"

- "How can science DEEPEN faith?"

**Examples:**

- Science asks HOW — Faith asks WHY

- Science reveals CREATION — Faith reveals CREATOR

- Truth cannot contradict truth!

**St. Thomas Aquinas:**

- Combined the best of ancient philosophy with Christian faith

- Showed that reason leads to God

- His work is still studied 800 years later!

**Challenge:** "This year, YOU will live this harmony. You'll show younger students that faith and learning belong together."

### Advanced Goal Setting (15 min)
