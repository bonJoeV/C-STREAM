# Weeks 19-22: Passion Project Labs

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Stewardship of Talents** — God gives each person unique gifts, interests, and abilities. We're called to develop these fully and use them for good. Passion projects allow students to pursue God-given interests deeply.

### Scripture Connection
> "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters."
> — Colossians 3:23

### Saint Connection
**Bl. Pier Giorgio Frassati** — Young man who pursued his passions (mountain climbing, engineering studies) while serving the poor and living his faith joyfully. He showed that pursuing interests and serving God go together.
