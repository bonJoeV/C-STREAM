# Week 11: Gratitude & Coding

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Eucharist and Thanksgiving** — The word "Eucharist" comes from the Greek word for "thanksgiving." The Mass itself is our great act of thanksgiving. Gratitude transforms our hearts and helps us recognize God's gifts in our lives.

### Scripture Connection
> "Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:18

### Saint Connection
**St. Ignatius of Loyola** — Founder of the Jesuits, he developed the Examen prayer, a daily practice of reviewing the day to find God's presence and express gratitude. He believed finding God in all things leads to grateful hearts.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (6 min)
**Prayer:** Use the Daily Examen (simplified):

- "Become still. God is with you."

- "Look back on today. What are you grateful for?"

- "Where did you see God working?"

- "What do you want to say to God?"

- "Look ahead with hope."

**Gratitude science:**

- "Research shows gratitude improves health, happiness, relationships"

- "It's not just religious — it's scientifically proven!"

- "But we knew this — the Mass is literally THANKSGIVING!"

**Today's challenge:** "Create an interactive Gratitude Journal in Scratch that helps people practice daily thanksgiving."

### Advanced Scratch Concepts (10 min)
**New concepts for today:**

**Lists in Scratch:**

- Create a list: "Gratitude_List"

- Add to list: `add [item] to [Gratitude_List]`

- Display list on screen

- Retrieve items: `item [1] of [Gratitude_List]`

**User Input:**

- `ask [What are you grateful for?] and wait`

- Store answer: `answer`

- Add answer to list

**Random selection:**

- `item (pick random 1 to (length of [Gratitude_List])) of [Gratitude_List]`

**Demonstration code:**
```
When green flag clicked
Say "Welcome to the Gratitude Journal!" for 2 seconds
Ask "What's something you're grateful for today?" and wait
Add (answer) to [Gratitude_List]
Say (join "Thank you for sharing: " (answer)) for 2 seconds
```

### Project Development (22 min)
**Required features:**
1. Welcome message
2. Prompt for gratitude entry
3. Store entries in a list
4. Ability to view past entries
5. At least one creative addition

**Stretch features:**

- Categorize gratitude (people, nature, experiences, gifts)

- Include inspiring quotes or Scripture

- "Random gratitude" reminder from past entries

- Animation or music

- Date/time stamps (advanced)

**Sample flow:**
```
START → Welcome → Menu: Add Entry / View Entries / Random Gratitude
|
+-- Add Entry → Prompt → Store → Confirmation → Menu
+-- View Entries → Display List → Menu
+-- Random Gratitude → Pull Random Entry → Display → Menu
```

**Teacher circulates:**

- "How are you storing the entries?"

- "How does the user navigate?"

- "What makes this spiritually meaningful?"

### Testing & Sharing (5 min)
**Peer testing:**

- Try a neighbor's gratitude journal

- Add at least one entry

- Give feedback: What works? What could improve?

### Closing Reflection (2 min)
**Share creative additions:**

- What unique features did you add?

- How does your project help people practice gratitude?

**Faith Connection:** "St. Ignatius taught that finding God in ALL things leads to gratitude. Even in hard times, we can find something to thank God for. Your programs can help people build this habit!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for EVERYTHING — for this class, for each other, for our creativity, for technology that we can use for good. Help us be people of gratitude who see Your gifts everywhere. Amen."
