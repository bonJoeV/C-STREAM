# Week 4: Wonder Walk Scientists

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Wonder at Creation** — Scientists observe God's creation carefully. When we look closely at nature, we discover God's amazing design — the patterns in leaves, the way animals move, the cycle of seasons.

### Scripture Connection
> "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made."
> — Romans 1:20

### Saint Connection
**St. Hildegard of Bingen** — A Catholic nun who studied plants and nature. She wrote books about the natural world and saw God's beauty in creation.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, open our eyes to see the wonders of Your creation. Help us observe like scientists and worship like believers. Amen."

**Introduce the task:** "Scientists observe — they look very carefully and write down what they notice. Today, we're going to be scientist-explorers in God's creation!"

### Observation Sheet Explanation (3 min)
Explain the observation sheet sections:

- Draw what you see

- Write describing words

- Living or non-living?

- Wonder question

### Wonder Walk (18 min)
**Walk outdoors** with stops for observation:

- Stop 1: Find something LIVING (plant, insect, etc.)

- Stop 2: Find something NON-LIVING (rock, water, etc.)

- Stop 3: Find something BEAUTIFUL

- Stop 4: Find something INTERESTING

At each stop:

- Observe quietly for 30 seconds

- Draw and write observations

- Share one observation with a partner

**Teacher prompts:**

- "What do you notice?"

- "What does it look like? Feel like? Sound like?"

- "What wonder question do you have?"

### Closing & Sharing (5 min)
Return inside. Share discoveries:

- "What was the most interesting thing you observed?"

- "What wonder question do you have?"

**Faith Connection:** "When we study nature carefully, we see God's amazing design. Every leaf, every bug, every rock shows us something about how God made the world!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for the wonder of creation. Help us to always see Your beauty in the world. Amen."
