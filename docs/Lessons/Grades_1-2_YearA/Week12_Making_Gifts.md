# Week 12: Making Gifts

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gift of Self** — The best gifts come from our hearts and hands. When we make something for someone, we give them our time and love. God gave us the greatest gift — His Son, Jesus.

### Scripture Connection
> "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."
> — 2 Corinthians 9:7

### Saint Connection
**The Magi (Wise Men)** — They traveled far to bring gifts to baby Jesus. Their gifts showed their love and worship. We give gifts to show our love too.
