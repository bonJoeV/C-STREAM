# Weeks 5-6: KEVA Engineering Challenge

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Building God's Kingdom** — Like architects and engineers who build physical structures, we are called to build God's Kingdom through our actions and love. We build communities of faith through cooperation.

### Scripture Connection
> "Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain."
> — Psalm 127:1

### Saint Connection
**Noah** — Noah built the ark exactly as God instructed. He persevered even when the task was hard and others laughed at him. Good engineers follow plans and don't give up!

## 📚 Materials Needed

- KEVA planks (100-150 per table group)

- Building challenge cards

- Rulers for measuring

- "Test materials" (small toys/blocks for bridge tests)

# Session 1: Building Basics & Towers

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Loving God, help us work together like Noah — following directions and never giving up. Bless our hands as we build today. Amen."

**Discuss:** "What buildings do you know? Churches, homes, schools — they all need strong foundations!"

### KEVA Introduction (4 min)

- Show proper plank handling (one layer at a time)

- Demonstrate base-building techniques

- Introduce engineering vocabulary: base, foundation, support

### Building Challenge 1: Tallest Tower (15 min)
**Challenge:** Build the tallest tower you can that stands for 5 seconds.

**Rules:**

- Work with your partner

- Only KEVA planks (no tape!)

- Must stand on its own

**Process:**

- 2 min planning (discuss with partner)

- 10 min building

- 3 min testing and measuring

**Discussion prompts during building:**

- "What's working well?"

- "What would you try differently?"

### Closing Reflection (7 min)
**Measure towers** that are still standing.

**Reflection questions:**

- "What made towers fall?"

- "What made towers strong?"

- "How did you and your partner work together?"

**Faith Connection:** "Noah didn't build alone — he had his family helping. We build better when we work together!"

# Session 2: Bridge Building

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Jesus, You are the bridge between heaven and earth. Help us build bridges today that connect and support. Amen."

**Review:** "What did we learn about building strong structures?"

### Bridge Introduction (4 min)
**Discuss:** "What do bridges do?" (Connect places, let people cross)

**Faith connection:** "Bridges connect people. Jesus is our bridge to God!"

**Show:** Bridge elements — supports on each side, span across

### Building Challenge 2: Bridge (16 min)
**Challenge:** Build a bridge that spans 6 inches and holds a small toy.

**Setup:** Use books as "land" on each side (6 inches apart)

**Process:**

- 2 min planning

- 11 min building and testing

- 3 min modification and retest

**Prompts during building:**

- "How will you support the middle?"

- "What happens when you test it?"

### Celebration & Reflection (6 min)
**Test bridges** with toys.

**Reflection:**

- "What was hardest about building a bridge?"

- "How did you solve problems?"

- "What would you try next time?"

**Faith Connection:** "Engineers keep trying when things are hard. That's perseverance — just like Noah! God wants us to keep trying even when it's difficult."

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for the gift of creativity and problem-solving. Help us build Your kingdom with love and cooperation. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We were KEVA engineers! Ask your child: 'What made your tower/bridge strong?' 'What would you build differently?' Build together at home with blocks, cards, or other materials!"
