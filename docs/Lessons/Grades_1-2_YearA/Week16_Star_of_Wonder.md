# Week 16: Star of Wonder

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**God Guides Through Creation** — God used a star to guide the Magi to Jesus. Throughout history, God has used the natural world to speak to people. Creation points us to the Creator.

### Scripture Connection
> "We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."
> — Matthew 2:2

### Saint Connection
**The Magi (Wise Men)** — These ancient scientists studied the stars. When they saw a special star, they knew it meant something important. They followed it for months until they found Jesus!

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

**Read/Tell:** Brief telling of the Magi following the star (Matthew 2:1-12).

**Wonder questions:**

- "How did the Magi know to follow the star?"

- "How long do you think they traveled?"

- "What did they find at the end?"

### Star Science (8 min)
**Star facts for 1st-2nd graders:**

- Stars are very far away suns

- They look small because they're so far

- At night, we can see stars because the sun isn't lighting up the sky

- People have used stars to find their way for thousands of years

**Discussion:**

- "Have you ever seen stars at night?"

- "Why can't we see stars during the day?"

**Star patterns:** Show simple constellations (Big Dipper, Orion).

**Faith Connection:** "The Magi were star scientists! They studied the sky carefully. When they saw a new, special star, they knew God was doing something amazing!"

### Star Project (12 min)

### Closing Reflection (5 min)

**Faith Connection:** "The Magi were scientists who found Jesus! Studying the world God made can help us know God better. This Christmas, let the star remind you that Jesus is worth seeking!"
