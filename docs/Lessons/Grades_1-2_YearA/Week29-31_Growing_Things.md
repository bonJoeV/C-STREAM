# Weeks 29-31: Growing Things

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Spiritual Growth** — Just as plants need water, sunlight, and soil to grow, our faith needs prayer, the sacraments, and good actions to grow. God gives the growth, but we must do our part.

### Scripture Connection
> "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow."
> — 1 Corinthians 3:6

### Saint Connection
**St. Fiacre** — Patron saint of gardeners. He grew food and herbs to help sick people. He showed that caring for plants is a way of caring for God's creation and serving others.

# Session 1: Planting & Parable

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord of all creation, thank You for plants that give us food and beauty. Help us be good stewards of the seeds we plant today. May our faith grow like our plants! Amen."

**The Parable of the Sower** (Matthew 13:3-9):

- Tell the story: Some seeds fell on the path, on rocks, among thorns, and on good soil

- "What happened to each seed?"

- "What does the good soil represent?"

### Plant Science (6 min)
**What do plants need to grow?**

- Soil (nutrients and support)

- Water (like us needing food and drink)

- Sunlight (energy to grow)

- Air (plants breathe too!)

- Time (growth doesn't happen instantly)

**Faith Connection:** "Our faith needs things to grow too — prayer, learning about God, going to Mass, being kind. What kind of 'soil' is your heart?"

### Planting Activity (15 min)
**Step-by-step planting:**
1. Fill cup with soil (leave room at top)
2. Make small hole with finger
3. Place 2-3 seeds in hole
4. Cover gently with soil
5. Water lightly (spray bottle)
6. Label with name

**Scientific method introduction:**

- "We're doing an experiment!"

- "What do you predict will happen?"

- "We'll measure and record what we observe"

### Setting Up Tracking (5 min)
**Introduce growth chart:**

- We'll measure every session

- Draw what we observe

- Record the height

**Care plan:**

- Where will plants live? (sunny spot)

- Who will water them?

- How often?

**Closing Prayer:** "God, You make things grow. Help these seeds grow and help our faith grow too. Amen."

# Session 2: Observing & Measuring

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Check-In (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, thank You for the growth we see! Help us observe carefully like scientists and thank You like believers. Amen."

**Observe plants:** "What has changed since we planted?"

### Measurement & Recording (12 min)
**Scientific observation:**

- Look carefully at your plant

- Has anything sprouted?

- What does it look like?

**Measure and record:**

- Use ruler to measure height

- Record on growth chart

- Draw what you see

**Compare observations:**

- "Whose plant is tallest?"

- "Do all plants look the same?"

- "What might cause differences?"

### Plant Care Check (4 min)
**Review plant needs:**

- Does soil look dry? (Water if needed)

- Is it getting enough light?

- Any problems we notice?

### Connection Activity (7 min)
**Growing Faith reflection:**

- "Our plants need care every day"

- "What helps YOUR faith grow?"

**Create "Faith Growth" chart:**

- Things that help faith grow: prayer, Mass, being kind, learning about saints

- Things that hurt faith growth: forgetting God, being mean, not praying

**Personal reflection:**

- "What's ONE thing you can do this week to help your faith grow?"

### Closing (3 min)
**Observations sharing:** "What surprised you about your plant?"

**Faith Connection:** "Just like we can't MAKE the plant grow — we can only give it what it needs — we can't force our faith to grow. We do our part, and God does the growing!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for growth — in plants and in our hearts. Help us do our part. Amen."

# Session 3: Results & Celebration

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Final Observation (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord of the harvest, thank You for three weeks of watching things grow! Help us see Your hand in all creation. Amen."

**Final observation and measurement:**

- Measure plants one last time

- Complete growth chart

- Draw final plant picture

### Data Analysis (8 min)
**Look at our data:**

- "How much did your plant grow?"

- "Which week showed the most growth?"

- Create simple class graph of plant heights

**Discussion:**

- "Why did some plants grow more than others?"

- "What did we learn about what plants need?"

**Scientific conclusion:**

- "Plants need [sun, water, soil] to grow"

- "Growth takes time"

- "Different plants grow at different rates"

### Parable Connection (7 min)
**Return to Parable of the Sower:**

- "Remember the seeds in the story?"

- "Our plants were like the seeds on good soil"

- "What makes our hearts 'good soil' for faith?"

**Reflection questions:**

- "How has YOUR faith grown this year?"

- "What helped it grow?"

- "How can you be 'good soil'?"

### Celebration & Sending (10 min)
**Decorate pots** to take plants home.

**Write care instructions:**

- Keep in sunny spot

- Water when soil is dry

- Watch it grow!

**Faith Connection:** "Take your plant home and keep caring for it! Every time you water it, remember to 'water' your faith too — with prayer, kindness, and time with God."

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for the miracle of growth. Help our plants flourish and our faith bloom. May we always be good soil for Your Word. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We grew plants! Your child is bringing home their plant. Help them continue to care for it — water, sunlight, and love. Talk about the Parable of the Sower and how we can be 'good soil' for God's word. How can your family help each other's faith grow?"
