# Week 11: Thankful Coding

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gratitude as Prayer** — When we say "thank you" to God, we are praying. Gratitude opens our hearts to see all the gifts God gives us every day — family, friends, food, creation, and life itself.

### Scripture Connection
> "Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:18

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — Known for his Canticle of the Creatures, a prayer of thanks to God for Brother Sun, Sister Moon, and all of creation.

**Gratitude brainstorm:**

- "What are you thankful for?"

- List ideas: family, pets, food, school, friends, nature, God, health

**Introduce project:** "Today we'll create a ScratchJr animation that shows what we're thankful for!"

### Planning (5 min)
**Planning sheet:** Students draw/write 3 things they're thankful for.

Each scene will show:
1. A picture of the blessing
2. Words saying "I am thankful for..."
3. A character expressing thanks
