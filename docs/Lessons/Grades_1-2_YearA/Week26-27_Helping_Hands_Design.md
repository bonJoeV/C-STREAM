# Weeks 26-27: Helping Hands Design

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

**Catholic Social Teaching: Preferential Option for the Poor** — God calls us to care especially for those who are struggling. Engineers and designers can create things that help people in need.

### Scripture Connection
> "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
> — Matthew 25:40

### Saint Connection
**St. Vincent de Paul** — He organized practical help for poor people. He found creative solutions to help those in need with food, medicine, and shelter.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Jesus, You said when we help others, we help You. Open our hearts to see the needs of others. Guide our hands as we design to help. Amen."
