# Week 10: Strong Bridges

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Jesus as Bridge** — Jesus connects us to God the Father. Through Jesus, we can reach God. Like a bridge that lets people cross a gap, Jesus bridges the gap between us and heaven.

### Scripture Connection
> "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"
> — John 14:6

### Saint Connection
**St. John Paul II** — He was called a "bridge builder" because he brought people of different faiths together. He built bridges of understanding between people.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- Pictures of different bridge types

- KEVA planks or craft sticks

- Small plastic cups

- Pennies or small weights for testing

- Rulers

- Recording sheets

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Jesus, You are our bridge to God. Help us build strong bridges today and be bridge builders in our community. Amen."

**Show pictures** of real bridges:

- Beam bridge (flat across)

- Arch bridge (curved)

- Truss bridge (triangle shapes)

**Discuss:** "What makes bridges strong? Why do we need bridges?"

**Faith connection:** "Bridges connect people. Jesus connects us to God!"

### Bridge Challenge Introduction (3 min)
**Today's Challenge:**

- Build a bridge that spans 8 inches

- Bridge must hold a cup of pennies

- Use only KEVA planks or craft sticks

**Setup:** Books or blocks on each side, 8 inches apart.

### Design & Build (16 min)
**Partner planning (2 min):** Sketch your bridge idea.

**Building time (12 min):**

- Work with partner

- Build bridge across gap

- Test periodically with empty cup

**Testing (2 min per group):**

- Place cup on bridge

- Add pennies one at a time

- Count how many before bridge fails

- Record on class chart

### Reflection & Closing (6 min)
**Compare results:**

- Which bridges held the most?

- What designs were strongest?

- What would you change?

**Faith Connection:** "Just like we tested our bridges, our faith is tested sometimes. And just like adding supports makes bridges stronger, our church community supports us and makes our faith stronger!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for engineers who build bridges. Help us be bridge-builders too — connecting people with love and kindness. Amen."

## ✅ Assessment

- Participated in bridge design and building

- Tested bridge and recorded results

- Identified what made bridges strong or weak

---

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We built and tested bridges today! Ask your child: 'How many pennies did your bridge hold?' 'What would make it stronger?' Look for bridges in your community and talk about how they help connect people."
