# Weeks 19-22: STREAM Exploration Stations

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Many Gifts, One Body** — Just like the stations offer different activities, God gives each person different gifts. In the Body of Christ, we all have unique talents that work together.

### Scripture Connection
> "There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them... All these are the work of one and the same Spirit."
> — 1 Corinthians 12:4, 11

### Saint Connection
**Various Saints at Each Station** — Each station features a different saint who used their particular gifts for God's glory.
