# Weeks 2-3: Sphero Coding Adventures

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Stewardship of Gifts** — God gave humans the ability to create technology. When we learn to code, we're using the gifts God gave us — our logic, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. We use technology responsibly and for good purposes.

### Scripture Connection
> "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."
> — Colossians 3:23

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how people program robots to do helpful things — like delivering packages or helping in hospitals?"

## 📝 Week 2 Procedure: Introduction to Coding

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (30 minutes)

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer & Review | 3 min | Prayer and introduction |
| What is Coding? | 5 min | Unplugged introduction |
| App Demonstration | 7 min | Show Sphero Edu |
| Coding Practice | 12 min | Hands-on coding |
| Closing | 3 min | Reflection |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer (3 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for giving us creative minds that can solve problems. Help us to be patient as we learn something new today. Amen."

---

### 2. What is Coding? (5 minutes)

**Unplugged activity:**
> "Before we use the robots, let's understand what coding is."

Have one student be the "robot":

- Give specific commands: "Take 3 steps forward. Turn right. Take 2 steps forward."

- The "robot" must follow EXACTLY

- Point out: The robot only does what you tell it!

**Key concept:**
> "A program is a list of instructions. The computer or robot does exactly what you tell it — nothing more, nothing less. That's why we have to be very specific!"

---

### 3. App Demonstration (7 minutes)

**Show Sphero Edu on projector:**

**Block Mode basics:**
1. **Roll block** — makes Sphero move
2. **Delay** — makes Sphero wait
3. **Turn** — changes direction
4. **Loop** — repeats commands

**Create a simple program together:**
1. Roll forward 1 second
2. Wait 1 second
3. Roll backward 1 second

> "Watch what happens!" (Run program)

**Debugging:**
> "What if it doesn't do what you expected? That's called a BUG. We DEBUG by finding and fixing the problem."

---

### 4. Coding Practice (12 minutes)

**Distribute Spheros and iPads** (groups of 2-3).

**Challenge 1: Make Sphero move forward and stop**
**Challenge 2: Make Sphero move forward, then backward**
**Challenge 3: Make Sphero move in a square pattern**

**Teacher circulates:**

- "What are you trying to make it do?"

- "Is it doing what you expected?"

- "What could you change?"

**Encourage collaboration:**
> "Work together! One person can code while others observe and suggest."

---

### 5. Closing (3 minutes)

**Discussion:**

- "What was easy about coding?"

- "What was challenging?"

- "How did you fix problems?"

**Journal entry:** Draw your favorite thing Sphero did today.

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for helping us learn to code. Help us to be patient and to keep trying. Amen."

## 📝 Week 3 Procedure: Coding Challenge

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (30 minutes)

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer & Review | 3 min | Review commands |
| Loop Introduction | 5 min | Teach loops |
| Challenge Course | 17 min | Complete challenges |
| Sharing & Closing | 5 min | Demonstrate and reflect |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer & Review (3 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, help us to work together and solve problems today. When we make mistakes, help us to learn from them. Amen."

**Quick review:**
> "What commands did we learn last week?"

---

### 2. Loop Introduction (5 minutes)

**Show the loop block:**
> "A LOOP makes something happen over and over. Instead of writing the same code 4 times, we can use a loop!"

**Example:**
Without loop: Roll forward, turn right, roll forward, turn right, roll forward, turn right, roll forward, turn right (makes a square)

With loop: LOOP 4 times: Roll forward, turn right

> "See how much easier that is?"

---

### 3. Challenge Course (17 minutes)

**Set up the room with tape paths/challenges.**

**Progressive challenges:**

| Challenge | Task | Skills |
|-----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Travel from A to B (straight line) | Basic roll |
| 2 | Navigate around a cone | Roll + turn |
| 3 | Make a square | Turns + loops |
| 4 | Navigate a simple maze | Problem solving |

**Groups rotate through challenges** or work at their own pace.

**Encourage debugging:**

- "It didn't work? Great! What will you try differently?"

- "How many times do you need to repeat that?"

---

### 4. Sharing & Closing (5 minutes)

**Demonstrations:**
> "Who wants to show us their solution to a challenge?"

Let 2-3 groups demonstrate.

**Discussion:**

- "What strategy helped you succeed?"

- "How did loops make coding easier?"

**Faith Connection:**
> "When we code, we're using the logical minds God gave us. God made us to be problem solvers! These same skills help us solve problems in real life too."

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Thank you, God, for helping us think logically and solve problems. Help us to use technology to do good things. Amen."

## 🔄 Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-made code to modify

- Partner with tech-confident student

- Simpler challenges (straight lines only)

- Hand-over-hand guidance

### For Advanced Learners

- Add sounds and lights to program

- Create a dance routine

- Design their own challenge for others

- Use variables (speed changes)

---

## 📎 Home Connection

**Family Note:**
> "We're learning to code with Sphero robots! Your child is learning to create programs using block-based coding. Key vocabulary: SEQUENCE (order of commands), LOOP (repeat), DEBUG (find and fix errors). At home, play 'Robot' — give exact directions to walk somewhere. If your 'robot' hits something, debug your directions!"
