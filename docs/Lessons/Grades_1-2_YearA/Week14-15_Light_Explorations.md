# Weeks 14-15: Light Explorations

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Jesus is the Light** — Just as physical light helps us see, Jesus helps us see what is good and true. During Advent, we prepare for the Light of Christ to enter the world at Christmas.

### Scripture Connection
> "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
> — John 8:12

### Saint Connection
**St. Lucy** — Her name means "light." She brought food and light to Christians hiding in dark caves. We celebrate her feast day (Dec 13) during Advent as we wait for the Light of Christ.

# Session 1: Light & Shadows

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Advent Prayer:** "Lord Jesus, You are the Light of the World. As we learn about light today, help us see Your light in our lives. Come, Lord Jesus! Amen."

**Light discussion:**

- "Where does light come from?" (Sun, lamps, candles, screens)

- "What happens when there's no light?" (Darkness, can't see)

- "Why is light important?"

### Light Sources Exploration (8 min)
**Natural vs. artificial light:**

- Natural: Sun, stars, fire

- Artificial: Lamps, flashlights, screens

**Faith Connection:** "The biggest light source is the sun. God created it on the fourth day! But there's an even greater light — Jesus, the Light of the World."

### Shadow Investigation (12 min)
**Shadow stations** (rotate in groups):

**Station 1: Shadow Making**

- Use flashlight and objects

- Make shadows bigger and smaller (move closer/farther)

- Draw around shadows

**Station 2: Shadow Puppets**

- Use cardboard cutouts

- Create shadow puppet show

- Tell a simple story

**Station 3: No Shadow Challenge**

- Can you make the shadow disappear?

- What happens with light from all sides?

### Closing Reflection (5 min)
**Discussion:**

- "How do shadows form?"

- "What makes shadows bigger or smaller?"

**Faith Connection:** "Shadows happen when something blocks light. Sin is like a shadow — it blocks God's light in our lives. But Jesus's light is so powerful, no shadow can overcome it!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Jesus, Light of the World, shine in our hearts. Push away the shadows. Help us walk in Your light. Amen."

# Session 2: Reflection & Being Light

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, help us reflect Your light to others today. Make us mirrors of Your love. Amen."

**Review:** "What did we learn about shadows?"

### Mirror Exploration (10 min)
**Mirror activities:**

- Look in mirror — what do you see?

- Use mirror to see around corners

- Use mirror to redirect flashlight beam

**Guided discovery:**

- "What happens to light when it hits a mirror?"

- "Can you bounce light from one place to another?"

**Challenge:** Use 2 mirrors to send light around a corner.

### Being Light Investigation (10 min)
**Discussion:** "Jesus says WE can be light too!"

> "You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden."
> — Matthew 5:14

**Brainstorm:** How can we be light to others?

- Smile at someone lonely

- Help someone who needs it

- Share what we have

- Tell the truth

- Be kind with our words

**"Light Cards":** Students draw/write one way they will be light this week.

### Closing Celebration (6 min)
**Light ceremony:** If appropriate, briefly darken room.

Teacher lights candle: "One small light can push back a lot of darkness."

**Discuss:** "How can your small act of kindness light up someone's day?"

**Faith Connection:** "Just like mirrors reflect light, we can reflect Jesus's light to everyone around us. This Advent, let's be mirrors that show His love!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Jesus, Light of the World, help us reflect Your light. Make us bright with kindness, love, and joy. Come, Lord Jesus! Amen."
