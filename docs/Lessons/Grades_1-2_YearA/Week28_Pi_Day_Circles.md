# Week 28: Pi Day Math & Coding

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**God's Mathematical Order** — God created the universe with beautiful mathematical patterns. Pi is a number that goes on forever — infinite, just like God! When mathematicians discovered pi, they found a glimpse of God's infinite design.

### Scripture Connection
> "He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart."
> — Ecclesiastes 3:11

### Saint Connection
**Fr. Georges Lemaître** — A Catholic priest and mathematician who used math to understand the universe. He showed that faith and mathematics work together.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, You made the universe with amazing patterns. Help us discover the wonder of circles today. Thank You for mathematicians who find Your design in numbers! Amen."

**Introduce Pi Day:**

- "March 14 is Pi Day! (3.14)"

- "Pi is a special number about circles"

- "It goes on FOREVER — 3.14159265359..."

**Wonder moment:** "A number that never ends! Just like God, pi is infinite!"

### Circle Hunt (5 min)
**Find circles everywhere!**

- Look around the room

- Identify circles (clocks, plates, wheels, etc.)

- Name circles in nature (sun, moon, flowers)

**Discussion:**

- "God made so many circles!"

- "Why do you think circles are so common in creation?"

### Circle Measurement (6 min)
**Simple activity:**

- Measure around different circles using string

- Compare: bigger circles = more string

- "The distance around a circle is related to pi!"

**Grade-appropriate explanation:**

- "If you measure across and then around, there's a special pattern"

- "Mathematicians call this pattern pi!"

### Sphero Circle Art (12 min)
**Setup:**

- Large paper on floor

- Attach marker to Sphero

- Program Sphero to draw circles

**Activity:**

- Students program Sphero to draw circles

- Layer different sizes

- Create circle art patterns

**Variations:**

- Small circles inside big circles

- Circle patterns and designs

- Collaborative class artwork

**Prompts:**

- "Can you make a bigger circle?"

- "What happens with different speeds?"

- "Can you make a pattern of circles?"

### Closing Celebration (3 min)
**Show circle art creations.**

**Faith Connection:** "The number pi goes on forever — it's infinite! Only God is truly infinite, but He put hints of His infinity in creation. When mathematicians study pi, they're exploring a tiny piece of God's amazing design!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for circles and pi and patterns everywhere. Your creation is full of wonder! Help us always see Your beauty in mathematics and science. Amen."

**Optional:** Share Pi Day treats (circular cookies, mini pies).
