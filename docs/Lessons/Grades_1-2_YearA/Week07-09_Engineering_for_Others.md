# Weeks 7-9: Engineering for Others

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Catholic Social Teaching: Care for Others** — We are called to serve those in need. Engineers and inventors can create things that help people. Using our minds to help others is a way of serving God.

### Scripture Connection
> "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others."
> — 1 Peter 4:10

### Saint Connection
**St. Giuseppe Moscati** — A Catholic doctor and scientist who used his knowledge to help sick people, especially the poor. He showed that we can use science to serve others.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- Design challenge scenarios

- Drawing paper and crayons

- Building materials: paper, cardboard, tape, craft sticks

- Scissors (teacher-assisted)

- Testing materials specific to challenge

# Session 1: Meet the Challenge

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Loving God, You gave us minds to think and hands to create. Show us how to use our gifts to help others. Amen."

**Discuss:** "What problems do people have? How can inventors help solve them?"

### Service Challenge Introduction (8 min)
**Present the scenario:**
"A friend in a wheelchair can't reach items on high shelves. How can we design something to help?"

**Empathy discussion:**

- "How would it feel to not reach things you need?"

- "What would help?"

- "What would a good helper tool need to do?"

### Design Thinking: Brainstorm (12 min)
**Individual sketching (5 min):** Draw 2-3 ideas for solutions.

**Partner share (4 min):** Share ideas with a partner. What do you like about each other's ideas?

**Whole group (3 min):** Share some ideas. List possibilities.

### Closing Planning (6 min)
**Choose your design:** Each student/pair selects one idea to build.

**Planning questions:**

- What materials will you need?

- How big should it be?

- How will you test if it works?

**Faith Connection:** "Thinking about what others need is called empathy. Jesus wants us to put ourselves in others' shoes!"

# Session 2: Build & Test

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (3 min)
**Prayer:** "Jesus, help us build with love and care for others. Guide our hands and our hearts. Amen."

**Review plans:** "What are you building today? What materials do you need?"

### Building Time (20 min)
Students build their designs using available materials.

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Tell me about your design."

- "How does this part help?"

- "What are you going to try next?"

**Problem-solving support:**

- Encourage iteration: "What if you tried..."

- Focus on function: "Will this help reach high things?"

### Initial Testing (7 min)
**Test designs** with a high shelf scenario.

**Testing questions:**

- "Does it reach?"

- "Is it easy to use?"

- "What would make it better?"

**Note:** Designs don't need to be perfect! Learning from what doesn't work is part of engineering.

**Transition:** "Engineers always test and improve. Next time, we'll make our designs even better!"

# Session 3: Improve & Present

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (3 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, thank You for helping us serve others through our ideas. Help us make our designs even better. Amen."

**Recall testing:** "What worked well? What needs improvement?"

### Improvement Time (12 min)
Students improve their designs based on testing.

**Prompts:**

- "How can you make it reach farther?"

- "How can you make it stronger?"

- "How can you make it easier to use?"

### Final Testing (5 min)
Test improved designs. Celebrate successes!

### Design Presentations (7 min)
Students share designs with class:

- "This is my helping tool."

- "It helps by..."

- "I improved it by..."

### Closing Celebration (3 min)
**Faith Connection:** "You used your minds and hearts to help others! That's exactly what God calls us to do — to love our neighbors and use our gifts to serve."

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for creative minds. Help us always use our gifts to help others and build Your kingdom of love. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We were engineers for service! Your child designed something to help others. Ask them: 'Who were you trying to help?' 'How does your invention work?' 'What did you improve?' Talk about ways your family can help others with your skills and talents."
