# Week 33: New Life Engineering

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Resurrection and New Life** — At Easter, we celebrate Jesus rising from the dead. Spring shows us new life all around — flowers blooming, butterflies emerging, baby animals being born. Creation reflects the Resurrection!

### Scripture Connection
> "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die."
> — John 11:25

### Saint Connection
**St. Mary Magdalene** — She was the first to see Jesus risen from the dead on Easter morning. She went from sadness to JOY when she saw that new life had conquered death.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- Pictures of spring/new life (butterflies, flowers, baby animals)

- Building materials: paper, cardboard, pipe cleaners, pom poms

- Scissors and tape

- Spring nature items (optional: seeds, flowers)

- Resurrection story visual

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Easter Prayer:** "Risen Jesus, You conquered death and brought us new life! As we see new life in spring, help us remember Your Resurrection. Alleluia! Amen."

**Signs of new life:**

- "What signs of spring do you see?"

- List: flowers, butterflies, baby birds, green leaves, longer days

- "After the cold and darkness of winter, new life comes!"

**Faith Connection:** "Easter is like the biggest spring ever! Jesus was in the dark tomb, but He rose to new life. He's stronger than death!"

### Engineering Challenge Introduction (4 min)
**Today's Challenge: Build something that shows NEW LIFE**

**Options:**
1. **Butterfly** — Design a butterfly with moving wings
2. **Flower** — Create a flower that can "bloom" (open and close)
3. **Bird Nest** — Build a nest that can hold eggs
4. **Anything else** that shows new life in spring!

**Design criteria:**

- Shows the idea of "new life"

- Has at least one moving or interactive part

- Uses available materials creatively

### Design & Build (16 min)
**Quick plan (3 min):**

- Choose your project

- Sketch your idea

- List materials

**Building time (13 min):**
Students create their new life projects.

**Teacher prompts:**

- "How does this show new life?"

- "What's your moving part?"

- "What would make it better?"

**Encourage creativity:**

- There's no one right way!

- Try different approaches

- It's okay if it's not perfect

### Sharing & Closing (5 min)
**Quick share:** Students show creations and explain:

- "This shows new life because..."

- "It moves like this..."

**Faith Connection:** "Your creations show new life! Every butterfly, flower, and baby bird reminds us that God brings new life from what seemed dead. Jesus's Resurrection is the greatest new life of all!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Risen Jesus, thank You for the gift of new life! Thank You for spring, for Easter, and for the promise that we will live forever with You. Help us share the joy of Your Resurrection with everyone we meet. Alleluia! Amen."
