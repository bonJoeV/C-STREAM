# Week 1: Welcome to C-STREAM

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Faith and Reason** — In Catholic teaching, faith and reason are not opposed — they work together! Science helps us understand HOW God's creation works, while faith helps us understand WHY God created it.

### Scripture Connection
> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge."
> — Psalm 19:1-2

### Catholic Scientist Connection
**Gregor Mendel** — A Catholic monk who discovered how traits are passed from parents to children (genetics). He studied pea plants and is called the "Father of Genetics."

### Wonder Question
> "Have you ever wondered how scientists and people of faith can both love learning? Because God made our minds to be curious!"

## 📝 Lesson Procedure

### ⏱️ Timing Guide (30 minutes)

| Section | Time | Activity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Opening Prayer & Wonder | 3 min | Prayer and wonder question |
| What is C-STREAM? | 8 min | Letter exploration and meaning |
| Faith + Science | 7 min | Catholic scientists |

---

### 1. Opening Prayer & Wonder Moment (3 minutes)

**Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for giving us curious minds. This year, help us to learn amazing things about Your creation and to grow closer to You through everything we discover. Amen."

**Wonder Question:**
> "If you could learn about ANYTHING in the world, what would it be?"

Take 2-3 quick responses.

---

### 2. What is C-STREAM? (8 minutes)

**Introduce each letter:**
> "Welcome to C-STREAM! The 'C' stands for Catholic — because we're learning in a Catholic school where we connect everything to our faith."

| Letter | Stands For | What We Do | God Connection |
|--------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **C** | Catholic | Learn with faith | God guides our learning |
| **S** | Science | Ask questions, experiment | Understand God's creation |
| **T** | Technology | Use tools, code robots | Use gifts wisely |
| **R** | Religion | Pray, connect to faith | Everything leads to God |
| **E** | Engineering | Design, build, solve | Create like God creates |
| **A** | Arts | Draw, music, design | Create beauty |
| **M** | Math | Count, measure, patterns | See God's order |

**Practice chant with motions:**
> "C-STREAM helps us learn and grow, about the world that God made so!"

**Key Point:**
> "In C-STREAM, we don't just learn science OR faith — we learn both TOGETHER!"

---

### 3. Faith + Science (7 minutes)

**Big Idea:**
> "Some people think you can't believe in God AND be a scientist. But that's not true! Many amazing scientists were Catholics!"

**Introduce Catholic Scientists:**

**Gregor Mendel** (Show picture)
> "Gregor Mendel was a monk — a man who devoted his life to God. He also studied pea plants and discovered how parents pass traits to their children. He's called the Father of Genetics!"

**Georges Lemaître** (Show picture)
> "Father Lemaître was a Catholic priest AND a scientist. He came up with the Big Bang theory — the idea that the universe started from a tiny point and expanded. A priest helped us understand how the universe began!"

**Discussion:**

- "Can you be a person of faith AND a scientist?" (YES!)

- "Why do you think these Catholics wanted to study science?" (To understand God's creation better)

---

### 4. Goal Setting (9 minutes)

**Introduce goal-setting:**
> "This year, you're going to learn SO many things. But first, let's think about what YOU want to learn."

**Distribute "My STREAM Goals" worksheet.**

**Guide students through:**

1. **What I already know** — Draw one thing you already know about science or technology
2. **What I want to learn** — Draw something you want to learn this year
3. **My goal** — Circle or write one goal:
   - I will try new things
   - I will ask questions
   - I will help my friends learn
   - I will keep trying when things are hard
   - I will see God in what I learn

**Students work for 5-6 minutes while teacher circulates.**

---

### 5. Closing (3 minutes)

**Partner share:**
> "Turn to a neighbor and share your goal."

**Wonder Wall:**
> "Our Wonder Wall is where we put questions about things we wonder about. If you have a wonder question, you can add it anytime!"

**Closing Prayer:**
> "Dear God, thank you for this year of learning ahead. Help us to ask good questions, work hard, help our friends, and see You in everything we discover. Amen."
