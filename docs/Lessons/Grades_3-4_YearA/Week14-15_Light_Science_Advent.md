# Weeks 14-15: Light Science & Advent

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Christ, the Light of the World** — Light is one of the most powerful symbols in Catholic faith. Jesus called Himself the Light of the World. During Advent, we prepare for the coming of this Light. Understanding the science of light deepens our appreciation of this metaphor.

### Scripture Connection
> "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
> — John 8:12

### Saint Connection
**St. Lucy** — Her name means "light." Her feast day (December 13) falls during Advent, reminding us that light comes into darkness. She's often depicted with candles, representing Christ's light.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- Flashlights (1 per group)

- Small mirrors

- Prisms

- Clear water cups

- White paper

- Pencils (for refraction demo)

- Advent candles or imagery

- Dark space for experiments

# Session 1: Light Behavior

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Advent Prayer:** "Lord Jesus, You are the Light of the World. As we learn about light today, help us see You more clearly. In this Advent season, prepare our hearts for Your coming. Come, Lord Jesus! Amen."

**Hook:** Dim lights. Turn on flashlight.

- "What happens when there's no light?"

- "How does light change everything?"

**Advent connection:**

- "Advent is about waiting for the Light"

- "The world was in spiritual darkness before Jesus came"

### Light Properties (10 min)
**Key concepts:**

**1. Light travels in straight lines**

- Demonstrate with flashlight and dust particles

- "That's why shadows have sharp edges"

**2. Light can be reflected**

- Demonstrate with mirror

- Angle of incidence = angle of reflection

- "That's how we see things — light bounces off objects to our eyes"

**3. Light can be refracted (bent)**

- Put pencil in glass of water

- "Light bends when passing through different materials"

**4. Light is made of colors**

- Show prism splitting white light

- "White light contains all colors — ROYGBIV"

### Experiment Stations (18 min)
**Rotate through 3 stations (6 min each):**

**Station 1: Reflection Investigation**

- Use mirrors to redirect light

- Challenge: Hit target with reflected beam

- Record angle observations

**Station 2: Refraction Exploration**

- Observe pencil in water

- Try different water levels

- Draw what you see

**Station 3: Rainbow Creation**

- Use prism to split light

- Identify colors in spectrum

- Draw the rainbow pattern

### Advent Connection (5 min)
**Discussion:**

- "Light chases away darkness"

- "Jesus chases away spiritual darkness"

- "In Advent, we light candles to remind us light is coming"

**Reflection question:** "Where do you need Jesus's light in your life?"

### Closing (2 min)
**Faith Connection:** "The properties of light — reflecting, revealing colors, cutting through darkness — help us understand Jesus. He reflects God's glory, reveals truth, and brings light into our darkness."

**Closing Prayer:** "Jesus, Light of the World, shine in our hearts this Advent. Help us reflect Your light to others. Amen."

# Session 2: Light in Faith

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, You said 'Let there be light' at creation. You sent Your Son as Light for the world. Help us be children of light. Amen."

**Review:** "What did we learn about how light behaves?"

### Light in Catholic Worship (10 min)
**Explore how light is used in faith:**

**1. Candles**

- Paschal candle: Christ's resurrection

- Baptismal candle: New Christian carries Christ's light

- Advent candles: Growing light as Christmas approaches

- Sanctuary lamp: Christ present in tabernacle

**2. Church Architecture**

- Stained glass: Light transformed into beauty

- Windows facing east: Light of risen Christ

- Dark → light: Journey from sin to salvation

**3. Liturgical Language**

- "Light of Christ" — Easter Vigil

- "Christ our Light" — Baptism

- "Enlighten the darkness" — Prayers

**Discussion:** "Why do you think light is so important in Catholic worship?"

### Being Light Investigation (10 min)
**Jesus said we should be light:**
> "You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden." — Matthew 5:14

**Brainstorm:** How can we be light?

- Kindness in darkness of meanness

- Truth in darkness of lies

- Hope in darkness of despair

- Help in darkness of need

**Reflection activity:** Students write/draw one way they will "be light" this Advent.

### Light Art/Craft (12 min)
**Create an Advent Light project:**

**Option A: Stained Glass Art**

- Black paper frame

- Tissue paper "glass"

- Hold to light to see effect

**Option B: Reflection Art**

- Use mirror and light to create patterns

- Capture with drawing

**Option C: Spectrum Art**

- Use prism colors as inspiration

- Create rainbow-themed Advent art

### Closing Celebration (3 min)
**Share:** Students show art and share how they'll be light.

**Faith Connection:** "Every time you see a candle, remember: Jesus is the Light of the World, and YOU are called to carry that light. This Advent, let your kindness, truth, and love be a light for others!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Lord Jesus, come and be our Light. Help us shine for others. In this Advent season, prepare us to receive You. May our light grow brighter each day until Christmas and beyond. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We studied light science and Advent connections! Ask your child: 'How does light behave?' 'How is light used in church?' 'How can you be light to others?' Notice candles and light symbols in church this Advent. As you light your Advent wreath, talk about how Jesus brings light into darkness."
