# Week 1: Welcome to C-STREAM

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Faith and Reason** — Pope St. John Paul II wrote that "faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises." In C-STREAM, we don't choose between faith and science — we use both to understand God's creation and serve others.

### Scripture Connection
> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."
> — Psalm 19:1

### Saint Connection
**St. John Paul II** — This pope was a philosopher, theologian, and champion of the harmony between faith and reason. He encouraged Catholics to embrace science as a way to know God better.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (6 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, thank You for the gift of curious minds. As we begin our C-STREAM journey, help us see Your wonder in all we learn. Unite us as a community of learners who support and encourage one another. Amen."

**Icebreaker:** "What's something you've wondered about or wanted to build/create?"

### What is C-STREAM? (10 min)
**Unpack the acronym:**

- **C** — Catholic (our identity; faith guides everything)

- **S** — Science (exploring God's creation)

- **T** — Technology (tools we use and create)

- **R** — Religion (the heart of who we are)

- **E** — Engineering (solving problems with design)

- **A** — Art (creative expression and beauty)

- **M** — Math (patterns and logic in creation)

**Discussion:**

- "Why do you think Religion is in the middle?"

- "How might science and faith work together?"

- "Have you heard of any scientists who were also people of faith?"

**Show examples** of projects that combine multiple STREAM areas.

### Faith + Science: Partners, Not Enemies (8 min)
**Key teaching:**

- Some people think you have to choose between faith and science — NOT TRUE!

- The Catholic Church has supported science for centuries

- Many great scientists were Catholic (Galileo, Mendel, Lemaître)

**Mini-stories:**
1. **Gregor Mendel** — A monk who discovered genetics by studying pea plants
2. **Fr. Georges Lemaître** — A priest who proposed the Big Bang theory
3. **Sister Mary Kenneth Keller** — First American woman to earn a PhD in computer science

**Reflection:** "Science tells us HOW things work. Faith tells us WHY they matter. We need both!"

### Community Expectations (10 min)
**Establish our C-STREAM community values:**

**Brainstorm together:** "What do we need from each other to learn well?"

**Core expectations:**
1. **Respect** — Ideas, materials, and each other
2. **Collaboration** — We learn better together
3. **Perseverance** — We don't give up when it's hard
4. **Wonder** — We stay curious and ask questions
5. **Faith** — We see God in all our learning

**Create visual:** Students sign or add to community covenant.

### Growth Mindset Introduction (4 min)
**Key message:** In C-STREAM, mistakes are learning opportunities!

**"Not Yet" mindset:**

- "I can't do this" → "I can't do this YET"

- "This is too hard" → "This is challenging my brain to grow"

- "I failed" → "I learned what doesn't work"

**Faith connection:** "God made us to grow and learn. Every challenge is an opportunity!"

### Closing & Preview (2 min)
**Preview:** "Next week, we'll dive into coding with Sphero!"

**Exit ticket:** On sticky note: "One thing I'm excited about in C-STREAM this year."

**Closing Prayer:** "Lord, bless our C-STREAM community. Help us learn with open minds and hearts. May everything we discover and create give glory to You. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "Welcome to C-STREAM! Today we explored how Catholic education combines faith and science. Ask your child: 'What does C-STREAM stand for?' 'Why is faith important in science?' This year, we'll learn that faith and reason work together — just like Pope St. John Paul II taught!"
