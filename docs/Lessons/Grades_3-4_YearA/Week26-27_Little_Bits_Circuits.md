# Weeks 26-27: Little Bits Circuits

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Body of Christ** — St. Paul taught that the Church is like a body where every part matters. Circuits work the same way — every component has a role. If one part fails, the whole circuit fails. We need each other!

### Scripture Connection
> "For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body."
> — Romans 12:4-5

### Saint Connection
**St. Joseph the Worker** — Patron saint of workers, including those who work with electricity and technology. He reminds us that all honest work honors God.

# Session 1: Circuit Basics

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, You built energy and electricity into Your creation. Help us understand how circuits work and how each part matters — just like each of us matters in Your family. Amen."

**Hook:** Turn on a light. "What makes this work?"

**Discuss electricity:**

- Electricity is the flow of energy

- Circuits provide a path for electricity

- Every device you use has circuits!

### Circuit Concepts (8 min)
**Three types of Little Bits:**

**1. POWER (blue)**

- Provides energy to the circuit

- Like the battery or outlet

- Every circuit STARTS with power

**2. INPUT (pink)**

- Controls the circuit

- Buttons, switches, sensors

- "Tells" the circuit what to do

**3. OUTPUT (green)**

- Does something!

- Lights, motors, buzzers, speakers

- The "result" of the circuit

**Circuit rule:** Power → (Input) → Output

**Faith connection:** "In the Body of Christ, we all have different roles too. Some people are good at leading, some at helping, some at teaching. Each role is needed!"

### Guided Exploration (12 min)
**Build together:**

**Circuit 1: Simple Light**

- Power → Light

- See it work!

**Circuit 2: Button Light**

- Power → Button → Light

- Now YOU control it!

**Circuit 3: Dimmer Light**

- Power → Dimmer → Light

- Control HOW MUCH

**Discussion:**

- "What happens if you remove the power?"

- "What happens if you change the order?"

### Free Exploration (12 min)
**Explore available bits:**

- What inputs do we have?

- What outputs are available?

- What combinations can you make?

**Challenge cards:**

- Make a buzzer you can control with a button

- Make a motor that spins at different speeds

- Make lights that respond to sound

### Closing & Preview (3 min)
**Share discoveries:** "What cool circuit did you make?"

**Faith Connection:** "Notice how every bit is needed? Take away the power — nothing works. Take away the output — nothing happens. That's like the Body of Christ. We need each other!"

**Preview:** "Next time, we'll use circuits to solve real problems!"

# Session 2: Circuit Design Challenge

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, You are the power source of our lives. Help us build circuits today and build Your kingdom with our lives. Amen."

**Quick review:** "What are the three types of bits? Why do we need each?"

### Design Challenge Introduction (6 min)
**Present challenges (teams choose one):**

**Challenge A: Night Light**

- Create a light that turns on automatically in the dark

- Use: Power → Light Sensor → LED

**Challenge B: Motion Alarm**

- Create an alarm triggered by motion

- Use: Power → Motion Trigger → Buzzer

**Challenge C: Fan Controller**

- Create a fan with multiple speed settings

- Use: Power → Dimmer → Fan

**Challenge D: Sound-Activated Light**

- Create lights that respond to clapping or sound

- Use: Power → Sound Trigger → LED

**Design criteria:**

- Must work reliably

- Must solve the stated problem

- Document your circuit diagram

### Design & Build (20 min)
**Teams work on circuits:**

**Process:**
1. Plan: Draw your circuit diagram (5 min)
2. Build: Construct and test (10 min)
3. Iterate: Fix problems and improve (5 min)

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Walk me through your circuit"

- "What does each bit do?"

- "What's not working? Let's troubleshoot"

**Troubleshooting questions:**

- "Is power connected and on?"

- "Are the bits in the right order?"

- "Is everything snapped tight?"

### Testing & Demonstration (7 min)
**Teams demonstrate circuits:**

- Show your circuit

- Explain what each bit does

- Demonstrate that it solves the problem

**Class feedback:**

- "What works well?"

- "What would you add?"

### Reflection & Closing (3 min)
**Discussion:**

- "What did you learn about circuits?"

- "What would you create with more bits?"

**Faith Connection:** "Remember — circuits only work when every part does its job and connects properly. That's exactly how the Body of Christ works. We each have gifts. When we connect and work together, amazing things happen!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for electricity and circuits that power our world. Thank You even more for our church family where each person matters. Help us stay connected to You and each other. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We learned about circuits with Little Bits! Ask your child: 'What are the three types of bits?' 'What circuit did you design?' 'How is the Body of Christ like a circuit?' Look at devices at home and talk about the circuits inside. Every electronic device has circuits that work like what we learned!"
