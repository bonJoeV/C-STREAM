# Weeks 19-22: STREAM Choice Labs

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Developing Talents** — The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25) teaches us to develop and use our God-given gifts. Choice Labs allow students to explore and strengthen their unique talents while serving others.

### Scripture Connection
> "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms."
> — 1 Peter 4:10

### Saint Connection
**Multiple Saints** — Different stations feature different saints who excelled in various areas (see station descriptions).
