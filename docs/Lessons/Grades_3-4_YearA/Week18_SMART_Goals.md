# Week 18: New Year SMART Goals

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Growth in Virtue** — The Christian life is a journey of growth. We're called to become more like Jesus — more loving, kind, patient, and holy. Setting goals helps us grow intentionally in virtue and use our God-given potential.

### Scripture Connection
> "Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."
> — Proverbs 16:3

### Saint Connection
**St. Ignatius of Loyola** — He developed the spiritual exercises and was famous for setting clear goals for spiritual growth. He taught that we should reflect, plan, and act with God's help.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**New Year Prayer:** "Lord, thank You for a fresh start! As we set goals, help us grow closer to You. Guide our plans and give us strength to follow through. We trust You with our year! Amen."

**Discuss:**

- "A new year is a fresh start!"

- "Why do people set goals?"

- "What happens to most New Year's resolutions?" (They fail!)

- "Today, we'll learn to set goals that WORK."

### SMART Goals Framework (10 min)
**Introduce SMART goals:**

**S — Specific**

- "What exactly will you do?"

- Vague: "Read more" → Specific: "Read one book per month"

**M — Measurable**

- "How will you track progress?"

- "How will you know when you've achieved it?"

**A — Achievable**

- "Can you actually do this?"

- Stretch yourself, but be realistic

**R — Relevant**

- "Does this matter to you?"

- "Does it fit your values and priorities?"

**T — Time-bound**

- "When will you accomplish this?"

- "What's your deadline?"

**Examples:**

- Vague: "Get better at math"

- SMART: "Improve my multiplication speed by completing 100 flash cards with 90% accuracy by March 1st"


- Vague: "Be nicer"

- SMART: "Give one sincere compliment every day for the next month"

### Goal Brainstorming (5 min)
**Three categories of goals:**

**1. Learning Goal (STREAM)**

- What skill do you want to develop?

- What do you want to know?

**2. Character Goal (Virtue)**

- What virtue do you want to grow in?

- How do you want to treat others?

**3. Faith Goal (Spiritual)**

- How do you want to grow closer to God?

- What spiritual practice do you want to develop?

**Quick brainstorm:** Students list 2-3 ideas for each category.

### SMART Goal Development (15 min)
**Students develop one goal fully:**

**Worksheet process:**
1. Choose one goal to make SMART
2. Write the specific goal
3. Define how you'll measure it
4. Check that it's achievable
5. Explain why it's relevant to you
6. Set a deadline
7. List 3-5 action steps

**Create tracking system:**

- Calendar marks

- Checklist

- Visual tracker (color in progress)

**Faith integration:**

- Add "prayer support" — when will you pray about this goal?

- Who will you ask to encourage you?

### Sharing & Commitment (5 min)
**Partner share:**

- Share your SMART goal

- Get feedback: "Is it truly SMART?"

- Commit to checking in with each other

**Faith Connection:** "St. Ignatius taught that we should make plans AND give them to God. Write your goals, work hard, AND pray for God's help. He wants us to grow!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Lord, we commit our goals to You. Help us grow in knowledge, virtue, and faith this year. When we struggle, give us strength. When we succeed, let us give You glory. Guide our steps every day. Amen."
