# Week 13: Fall STREAM Celebration

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Celebration and Thanksgiving** — Throughout the Bible, God's people celebrated after significant work was completed. We celebrate not to boast, but to give thanks to God for His gifts and to recognize our growth.

### Scripture Connection
> "Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth. Worship the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs."
> — Psalm 100:1-2

### Saint Connection
**All Saints** — We celebrate the saints because they used their gifts to serve God. Today we celebrate how we've used our STREAM gifts this semester!
