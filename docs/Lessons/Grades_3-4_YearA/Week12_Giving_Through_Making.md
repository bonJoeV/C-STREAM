# Week 12: Giving Through Making

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gift of Self** — Handmade gifts represent the gift of our time, creativity, and love. The best gifts come from the heart. God gave us the ultimate gift — Jesus — and we are called to be generous givers too.

### Scripture Connection
> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son."
> — John 3:16

### Saint Connection
**The Magi** — They brought gifts that had meaning: gold for a king, frankincense for God, myrrh for one who would die. Their gifts showed thought and intention. Our gifts can carry meaning too.

**Discuss:**

- "Why do we give gifts?"

- "What makes a gift meaningful?"

- "Why might a handmade gift be special?"

**Magi connection:**

- "The Wise Men brought meaningful gifts"

- "Their gifts showed they thought about who Jesus was"

- "Our gifts can show we've thought about the person receiving them"

### Planning Phase (5 min)
**Gift Planning worksheet:**
1. Who is this gift for?
2. What do they like/need?
3. Which project will you make?
4. How will you personalize it?
5. What will your card say?

**Design emphasis:**

- "Think about the PERSON, not just the project"

- "How can this gift be special for THEM?"

### Creation Time (20 min)
**Students create their gifts.**

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Tell me about who this is for"

- "How does this show you were thinking about them?"

- "What will make this special?"

**Quality encouragement:**

- Take your time

- Measure twice, cut once

- Details show care

- It doesn't have to be perfect to be meaningful

**Card creation:** Students also create gift card explaining their gift and expressing their love.

### Sharing & Closing (5 min)
**Quick share:** Students show gifts and explain who they're for.

**Reflection:**

- "How did thinking about the person change how you made the gift?"

- "How does it feel to create something for someone else?"

**Faith Connection:** "God thought about US when He sent Jesus. He knew exactly what we needed. When you made your gift, you thought about someone else's needs and wants. That's living out God's generous love!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for the joy of giving. Bless these gifts and the hands that made them. May they bring joy to those who receive them. Help us be generous givers all year long. Amen."
