2. Use events and sensors (collision, orientation)
3. Create programs that respond to conditions
4. Apply mathematical concepts (angles, distance)

### Faith Integration Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Connect programming sequences to God's order in creation
2. Understand that creativity in coding reflects being made in God's image
3. Practice patience and perseverance when debugging

# Weeks 2-3: Sphero Advanced Coding

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Order in Creation** — God created the universe with order and patterns. When we write code, we create order and logic — reflecting our Creator. Programming is a creative act that mirrors God's creative nature.

### Scripture Connection
> "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen."
> — Romans 1:20

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — A young Catholic who used his technology skills to serve God. He built websites about Eucharistic miracles and showed that technology can be a tool for faith.

# Session 1: Loops & Angles

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, You made the universe with beautiful order and patterns. Help us learn to create order in our code today. Give us patience when things don't work and creativity to find solutions. Amen."

**Quick review:**

- "Who has used Sphero before?"

- "What basic commands do you remember?"

- Review: roll, spin, lights, sounds

### New Concept: Loops (10 min)
**Introduce loops:**

- "A loop repeats code multiple times"

- "Instead of writing the same thing 10 times, we write it once in a loop!"

**Demonstrate:**

- Simple loop: "Repeat 4 times: roll forward, turn 90°" = square

- "How many lines of code did we save?"

**Math connection:**

- Angles: 90° = quarter turn, 180° = half turn, 360° = full turn

- "What angles make different shapes?"

- Triangle = 120° turns, Pentagon = 72° turns

### Guided Practice (12 min)
**Challenge 1: Square Dance**

- Program Sphero to draw a square using a loop

- Specify roll distance and 90° turns

**Challenge 2: Triangle Trip**

- Modify loop for a triangle

- Change angle to 120°

**Students work in pairs:**

- One programmer, one observer

- Switch roles after first challenge

**Teacher circulates:** "What angle are you using? Why?"

### Exploration Time (10 min)
**Open challenges:**

- Can you make a pentagon? Hexagon?

- Can you make a star?

- Try different sizes (change roll distance)

**Debugging support:**

- "What's happening vs. what you wanted?"

- "Check your angles"

- "Try printing step by step"

### Closing & Preview (3 min)
**Share discoveries:** "What shapes did you create?"

**Faith Connection:** "God built patterns into creation — from snowflakes to galaxies. When you create patterns with code, you're imitating your Creator!"

**Preview:** "Next time, we'll make Sphero respond to its environment!"

# Session 2: Sensors & Events

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, You gave us senses to understand the world around us. Today, we'll use Sphero's sensors to respond to its environment. Help us learn and create with joy. Amen."

**Review:** "What did we learn about loops? What shapes did you make?"

### New Concept: Events & Sensors (10 min)
**Introduce events:**

- "An event is something that triggers code to run"

- "Instead of 'when start pressed,' we can use 'when collision' or 'when shaken'"

**Sphero sensors:**

- **Collision** — Sphero senses when it hits something

- **Orientation** — Sphero knows which way is up

- **Speed** — Sphero knows how fast it's going

**Demonstrate:**

- Event: "On collision, change color to red and say 'Ouch!'"

- "Now when Sphero bumps into something, it reacts!"

### Guided Practice (12 min)
**Challenge 1: Collision Response**

- Program Sphero to change color when it hits something

- Add a sound effect

- Make it backup after collision

**Challenge 2: Smart Navigation**

- Program: Roll forward until collision

- On collision: backup, turn random direction, continue

**Students experiment:** "Can you make Sphero navigate around a maze?"

### Challenge Time (10 min)
**Partner challenges:**

**Challenge A: Maze Navigator**

- Set up simple tape maze

- Program Sphero to navigate using collision sensing

**Challenge B: Dance Party**

- Use shake sensor to trigger dance moves

- Different orientations = different colors

**Challenge C: Create Your Own**

- Design your own sensor-based program

### Reflection & Closing (4 min)
**Share creations:** Groups demonstrate one program.

**Debugging discussion:**

- "What was hardest to get working?"

- "How did you solve problems?"

**Faith Connection:** "God gave animals instincts to respond to their environment. We gave Sphero 'instincts' with our code! This is what it means to be co-creators with God — using our intelligence to create things that respond to the world."

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for the gift of creativity. Help us use technology to learn, to create, and to serve others. Amen."

## ✅ Assessment

### Session 1

- Created a program using loops

- Used correct angles for shapes

- Debugged programs when needed

### Session 2

- Used events and sensors in programming

- Created responsive programs

- Collaborated with partner on challenges

---

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We learned advanced Sphero coding! Ask your child: 'What does a loop do?' 'How did you make Sphero respond to hitting things?' Talk about patterns in nature that reflect God's design. If you have access to any coding apps, let them explore at home!"
