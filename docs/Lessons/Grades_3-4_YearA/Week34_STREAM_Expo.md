# Week 34: Year-End STREAM Expo

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gratitude and Celebration** — The Christian life includes celebration! Throughout Scripture, God's people celebrated milestones and gave thanks for completed work. Our STREAM Expo is an act of worship — giving thanks for all God has helped us learn and create.

### Scripture Connection
> "The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy."
> — Psalm 126:3

### Saint Connection
**All Our Saints** — Throughout the year, we've learned about Catholic scientists, engineers, artists, and more. They all used their gifts for God's glory — just like we're learning to do!
