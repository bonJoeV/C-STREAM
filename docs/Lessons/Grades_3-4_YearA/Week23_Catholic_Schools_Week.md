# Week 23: Catholic Schools Week STREAM

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Faith and Reason** — Pope St. John Paul II wrote "Fides et Ratio" (Faith and Reason), teaching that faith and reason are "like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth." Catholic education integrates both.

### Scripture Connection
> "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding."
> — Psalm 111:10

### Saint Connection
**Catholic Scientists:**

- **Gregor Mendel** (Genetics)

- **Fr. Georges Lemaître** (Big Bang Theory)

- **St. Albert the Great** (Universal Science)

- **Nicolaus Copernicus** (Heliocentrism)

- **Louis Pasteur** (Microbiology)

- **Sr. Mary Kenneth Keller** (Computer Science)

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Catholic Schools Week Prayer:** "Thank You, Lord, for Catholic schools where we learn to know You, love You, and serve You. Thank You for teachers who show us how faith and learning go together. Bless all Catholic schools! Amen."

**Discuss:**

- "What makes Catholic school different?"

- "Why do we have the 'R' in STREAM?"

- "Can you be a scientist AND a person of faith?"

### Catholic Scientists Research (15 min)
**Research activity:**

Students research a Catholic scientist (individually or pairs):

**Options:**
1. **Gregor Mendel** — Augustinian monk, father of genetics
2. **Fr. Georges Lemaître** — Priest who proposed the Big Bang
3. **St. Albert the Great** — Medieval scientist and saint
4. **Nicolaus Copernicus** — Catholic canon who proved heliocentrism
5. **Louis Pasteur** — Devout Catholic, developed germ theory
6. **Sr. Mary Kenneth Keller** — First American woman with CS PhD

**Research questions:**

- What did they discover/contribute?

- How did faith influence their work?

- What can we learn from them?

**Create mini-presentation:** Drawing, poster, or digital slide.

### Gallery Walk & Presentations (10 min)
**Share research:**

- Post presentations around room

- Gallery walk to see all scientists

- Quick verbal shares: "My scientist is... They discovered... They teach us..."

**Discussion:**

- "What did these scientists have in common?"

- "How did they show faith and reason work together?"

### Catholic STREAM Commitment (7 min)
**Create Catholic STREAM commitment:**

Students write/design a commitment showing how they will:

- Use STREAM to learn about God's creation

- Apply faith to their learning

- Use their talents to serve others

**Example:** "As a Catholic STREAM student, I will ask questions to learn about God's amazing creation, use my engineering skills to help others, and remember that all truth leads to God."

### Closing Celebration (3 min)
**Share commitments.**

**Faith Connection:** "You are inheriting an incredible tradition! For centuries, Catholics have led the way in science, technology, and discovery. They didn't choose between faith and learning — they used BOTH. That's what YOU are doing as C-STREAM students!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for Catholic schools. Thank You for scientists who showed us faith and reason work together. Help us be faithful learners who use our gifts for Your glory. Bless our school, our teachers, and all Catholic schools. Amen."
