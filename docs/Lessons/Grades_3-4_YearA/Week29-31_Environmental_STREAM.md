# Weeks 29-31: Environmental STREAM

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home** — Pope Francis calls us to care for creation as God's gift. The earth is our "common home," and caring for it is a matter of faith. Environmental action is a spiritual responsibility.

### Scripture Connection
> "The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."
> — Genesis 2:15

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — Patron saint of ecology. His Canticle of the Creatures celebrates "Brother Sun" and "Sister Moon" as part of God's family. Pope Francis named Laudato Si' after St. Francis's praise of creation.

# Session 1: Understanding Our Impact

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Canticle of Creation (adapted):**
"Praised be You, my Lord, for Sister Water, so useful and humble and precious and pure. Praised be You, my Lord, for Brother Fire, by whom You light up the night. Praised be You, my Lord, for Sister Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us. Help us care for Your creation. Amen."

**Introduction:**

- "God gave us a beautiful world — our common home"

- "Pope Francis wrote Laudato Si' — 'Praised Be You' — about caring for creation"

- "Today we'll explore how humans affect the environment"

### Environmental Investigation (15 min)
**School Environment Audit:**

**Teams investigate different areas:**

**Team 1: Waste**

- Check classroom trash

- What's thrown away that could be recycled?

- What's thrown away that could be reduced?

**Team 2: Energy**

- Count lights on in empty rooms

- Check for devices left on

- Identify energy waste

**Team 3: Water**

- Check for dripping faucets

- Observe water use habits

- Identify water waste

**Team 4: Nature**

- Survey plants and wildlife

- Observe outdoor spaces

- Identify areas needing care

**Record observations** on investigation sheets.

### Data Analysis (10 min)
**Teams share findings:**

- What did you discover?

- What surprised you?

- What could we change?

**Create class chart** of environmental issues found.

**Laudato Si' connection:**
> "We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth; our very bodies are made up of her elements."

**Discussion:** "We're part of creation, not separate from it. When we hurt the earth, we hurt ourselves."

### Reflection & Closing (10 min)
**Personal reflection:**

- "How do MY daily actions affect creation?"

- "What's one thing I could change?"

**Write in journal:**

- One thing I learned

- One thing I want to change

- How this connects to my faith

**Faith Connection:** "Caring for creation isn't just 'nice' — it's what God asks of us as stewards. When we care for the earth, we honor the Creator."

**Preview:** "Next session, we'll design solutions to the problems we found!"

# Session 2: Design for Creation Care

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, forgive us when we've failed to care for Your creation. Give us wisdom to design solutions and courage to act. Help us be good stewards. Amen."

**Review:** "What environmental issues did we discover?"

### Engineering Challenge Introduction (6 min)
**Design challenges (teams choose one):**

**Challenge A: Waste Reduction**

- Design a classroom recycling system

- Create a way to reduce lunch waste

- Build a composting solution

**Challenge B: Energy Saving**

- Design an "energy reminder" system

- Create a device to reduce energy use

- Build a model solar-powered device

**Challenge C: Water Conservation**

- Design a way to reduce water use

- Create a rainwater collection model

- Build a "water-wise" reminder system

**Challenge D: Creation Care Awareness**

- Design an educational game about environment

- Create a "care for creation" display

- Build a nature-enhancing feature for schoolyard

### Design Phase (8 min)
**Engineering design process:**
1. Define the problem (What are we solving?)
2. Research (What solutions exist?)
3. Brainstorm (What could we create?)
4. Select (Which idea is best?)
5. Plan (Draw design, list materials)

**Teams work through design process** with planning sheets.

### Build Phase (18 min)
**Construction time!**

**Using primarily recycled/repurposed materials** — model the change we want to see!

**Teacher circulates:**

- "How does this solve the problem?"

- "What impact will this have?"

- "How could you improve it?"

### Closing Preview (4 min)
**Quick sharing:** Show design progress.

**Faith Connection:** "You're not just building projects — you're answering God's call to care for His creation!"

**Preview:** "Next session, we finish, test, and present our solutions!"

---

# Session 3: Present & Commit

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (3 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, bless the work of our hands. May our projects truly serve Your creation. Give us the courage to follow through on our commitments to care for our common home. Amen."

### Final Build Time (10 min)
**Complete projects:**

- Finish construction

- Test functionality

- Prepare presentation

### Presentations (15 min)
**Teams present (3-4 min each):**
1. The problem we're solving
2. Our solution and how it works
3. Expected impact
4. How we'll implement it

**Audience response:**

- What's strong about this solution?

- How could it be improved?

### Creation Care Commitment (8 min)
**Personal and class commitments:**

**Personal:** Each student writes 2-3 specific actions they will take:

- "I will turn off lights when leaving rooms"

- "I will use a reusable water bottle"

- "I will recycle paper properly"

**Class commitment:** Create a class pledge:
"As Catholic STREAM students, we commit to caring for God's creation by..."

**Sign the pledge** as a class.

### Closing Celebration (4 min)
**Celebrate growth and commitment.**

**Final Faith Connection:** "St. Francis called the sun his brother and the moon his sister. He saw all creation as family. When we care for creation, we care for our family. Pope Francis reminds us this is our 'common home' — and we're called to be good stewards. Your projects and commitments are beautiful responses to God's call!"

**Closing Prayer:** "St. Francis, pray for us. Help us see all creation as our brothers and sisters. Help us be faithful stewards of God's gifts. Lord, renew in us a sense of wonder at Your creation and commitment to protect it. May everything we do give praise to You. Amen."

## ✅ Assessment

- Conducted environmental investigation

- Designed solution to environmental problem

- Created functional prototype/plan

- Made personal and class commitments

- Connected creation care to Catholic teaching

---

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We studied environmental stewardship! Ask your child: 'What environmental problems did you find?' 'What solution did you design?' 'What commitments did you make?' Discuss Pope Francis's Laudato Si' and how your family can care for creation. Consider making family creation care commitments together!"
