# Week 11: Coding Gratitude

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gratitude as Prayer** — St. Ignatius taught that gratitude is the foundation of our relationship with God. When we notice and name our blessings, we open our hearts to recognize God's presence in every part of life.

### Scripture Connection
> "Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:18

### Saint Connection
**St. Ignatius of Loyola** — Founder of the Jesuits, he developed the Daily Examen — a prayer practice that includes reviewing the day for moments of gratitude. He believed finding God in all things starts with thankfulness.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Gratitude Prayer:** "Generous God, You give us so many gifts! Help us notice Your blessings today. As we create, may our thankful hearts shine through. Thank You for life, for love, for this moment. Amen."

**Gratitude reflection:**

- "What are you thankful for today?"

- Quick sharing: Each student names one blessing

**St. Ignatius connection:**

- "St. Ignatius taught that gratitude opens our eyes to see God everywhere"

- "Today, we'll express our gratitude through code!"

### Project Introduction (5 min)
**Today's project:** Create a "Gratitude Animation" in Scratch

**Project requirements:**

- At least 3 things you're thankful for

- Multiple sprites (characters or objects)

- At least one broadcast message (sprites communicate)

- Sound or music

- Creative presentation

**Show example:** Teacher demonstrates a simple gratitude animation.

### Planning Phase (5 min)
**Students plan on paper:**
1. List 3+ things you're thankful for
2. What sprites will represent each?
3. How will they appear/animate?
4. What will the message say?
5. What sounds will you include?

### Scratch Creation (20 min)
**Building time!**

**Scratch skills focus:**

- **Broadcasts:** "When I receive" and "broadcast" blocks allow sprites to communicate

- **Timing:** "Wait" blocks sequence events

- **Effects:** "Change effect" blocks add visual interest

- **Sound:** "Play sound" and "play note" blocks

**Teacher supports:**

- Help students troubleshoot

- Encourage creativity

- Keep students on task

**Checkpoints:**

- 5 min: "Have you created your sprites?"

- 10 min: "Are your sprites communicating?"

- 15 min: "How's your timing and effects?"

### Sharing & Reflection (5 min)
**Quick share:** 2-3 students share projects with class.

**Reflection questions:**

- "How did coding help you express gratitude?"

- "What was challenging?"

- "What blessing is most meaningful to you?"

**Faith Connection:** "When we express gratitude — through prayer, words, OR code — we train our hearts to see God's goodness. St. Ignatius said gratitude is the foundation of joy. Keep noticing your blessings!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for the blessings we named today. Thank You for [students call out blessings]. Help us be thankful every day, in all circumstances. Amen."

## ✅ Assessment

- Created Scratch project with gratitude theme

- Used multiple sprites and broadcasts

- Included sound elements

- Expressed genuine gratitude for specific blessings

---

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We coded gratitude animations! Ask your child to share their Scratch project (at scratch.mit.edu). Discuss what they're thankful for. Try St. Ignatius's Daily Examen as a family: At dinner, share one thing you're grateful for from the day and one place you saw God's presence."
