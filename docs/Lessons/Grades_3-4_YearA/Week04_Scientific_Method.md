# Week 4: Scientific Method

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Science Reveals God's Creation** — Every time scientists discover something new about the universe, they're uncovering more of God's amazing design. The Church has always supported scientific inquiry because truth cannot contradict truth — science and faith both lead to truth.

### Scripture Connection
> "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings."
> — Proverbs 25:2

### Saint Connection
**St. Albert the Great** — Called "the Great" for his encyclopedic knowledge of science, this medieval saint studied physics, chemistry, biology, and more. He's the patron saint of scientists and showed that deep faith and deep scientific inquiry go together.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "God of all wisdom, You invite us to explore Your creation. Give us curious minds, careful hands, and honest hearts as we learn to think like scientists. May all we discover lead us closer to You. Amen."

**Hook:** Show a mystery phenomenon (e.g., pepper fleeing from soap on water, or a tower of liquids) without explaining.

**Question:** "What's happening here? How could we find out?"

### Scientific Method Steps (10 min)
**Introduce the scientific method:**

1. **Question** — What do you wonder about?
2. **Research** — What do you already know?
3. **Hypothesis** — What's your educated guess?
4. **Experiment** — Test your hypothesis
5. **Observe/Record** — What happened?
6. **Analyze** — What do the results mean?
7. **Conclusion** — Was your hypothesis right?

**Faith Connection:** "Scientists are truth-seekers. As Catholics, we believe all truth comes from God. When scientists discover truth about creation, they discover something about the Creator!"

**Key vocabulary:**

- **Hypothesis** — An educated guess you can test

- **Variable** — Something that can change

- **Control** — The thing you keep the same

### Class Experiment (18 min)
**Choose one experiment:**

**Option A: Paper Airplane Distance**

- Question: "Does the type of paper affect how far a plane flies?"

- Variables: Paper type (constant: plane design, throw)

- Test 3 different papers, measure distance

**Option B: Ramp and Roll**

- Question: "Does ramp height affect how far a ball rolls?"

- Variables: Ramp height (constant: ball, surface)

- Test 3 heights, measure roll distance

**Option C: Dissolving Race**

- Question: "Does water temperature affect how fast sugar dissolves?"

- Variables: Water temperature (constant: amount of sugar, stirring)

- Time how long until dissolved

**Experiment procedure:**
1. State question and form hypothesis (3 min)
2. Set up experiment (3 min)
3. Conduct 3 trials (8 min)
4. Record results (2 min)
5. Discuss findings (2 min)

### Reflection & Closing (7 min)
**Analyze results:**

- "Was your hypothesis correct?"

- "What surprised you?"

- "What would you test next?"

**Being wrong is okay!**

- "In science, a 'wrong' hypothesis is still useful — you learned something!"

- "Some of the greatest discoveries came from unexpected results"

**Faith Connection:** "St. Albert the Great said that studying nature is a form of worship. When we use the scientific method to understand creation, we're honoring the Creator. Every discovery reveals more of God's amazing design!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for the gift of curiosity. Help us be truth-seekers like the great Catholic scientists. May all we discover lead us to wonder at Your glory. Amen."

## ✅ Assessment

- Correctly identified scientific method steps

- Formed a testable hypothesis

- Recorded observations accurately

- Drew appropriate conclusions from data

---

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We learned the scientific method! Ask your child to explain the steps. Try a simple experiment at home: 'Does adding salt make water boil faster?' Follow the scientific method together. Discuss how discovering truth about creation helps us know God better!"
