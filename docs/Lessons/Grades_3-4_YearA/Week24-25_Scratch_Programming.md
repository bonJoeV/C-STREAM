# Weeks 24-25: Scratch Programming

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Logic and Moral Reasoning** — Conditional statements in coding (if/then) mirror moral reasoning. Just as programs follow logical rules, our moral lives have principles. "If we love God, then we will love others."

### Scripture Connection
> "If you love me, keep my commands."
> — John 14:15

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — A young computer programmer who used his skills to serve God. He created websites about Eucharistic miracles and is an example of using technology for faith.

# Session 1: Variables & Conditions

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Creative God, You made us in Your image with the ability to create. Help us learn to program today. May our creations reflect Your creativity and logic. Amen."

**Review:** "What do you remember about Scratch from earlier this year?"

**Introduce today's focus:** "Today we'll learn about VARIABLES and CONDITIONS — these are like the brain of a program!"

### Variables Introduction (10 min)
**What is a variable?**

- A container that stores information

- Can hold numbers, words, or true/false

- Can change as the program runs

**Examples:**

- Score in a game (starts at 0, increases)

- Lives remaining (starts at 3, decreases)

- Player name

**Demonstration:**

- Create a variable called "Score"

- Show how to change the variable

- Display it on screen

**Faith connection:** "Variables keep track of things. In life, our choices accumulate too — acts of kindness build character, acts of love strengthen relationships."

### Conditionals Introduction (8 min)
**What is a conditional?**

- An "if/then" statement

- The program makes a decision

- Different conditions lead to different outcomes

**Examples:**

- IF touching color, THEN lose a life

- IF score = 10, THEN you win

- IF key pressed, THEN move right

**Demonstration:**

- Add "if touching [red]" block

- Add consequence: "change lives by -1"

- Show how condition triggers action

**Faith connection:** "Jesus said, 'IF you love me, keep my commands.' Conditions work in faith too. Our choices lead to outcomes."

### Guided Practice: Simple Game Start (12 min)
**Build together:**
1. Create a simple "catch" game
   - One sprite the player controls
   - One sprite that falls from top
2. Add variable: "Score"
3. Add condition: IF touching falling sprite, THEN increase score

**Students follow along** step-by-step.

### Exploration & Closing (5 min)
**Short exploration:** Try modifying the game.

**Preview:** "Next session, we'll make our own complete games!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for logic and creativity. Help us use these gifts well. Amen."

# Session 2: Game Creation

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, help us create games that bring joy. Guide our logic and fuel our creativity. Amen."

**Quick review:**

- What are variables? Conditionals?

- How did we use them last time?

### Game Planning (6 min)
**Plan your game:**

**Game types:**

- **Catching game** — Catch falling objects

- **Maze game** — Navigate without touching walls

- **Clicking game** — Click sprites for points

- **Your own idea!**

**Planning worksheet:**
1. What's your game concept?
2. What variables do you need? (Score? Lives? Timer?)
3. What conditions will you use?
4. How do you win or lose?

### Game Creation Time (22 min)
**Students build their games.**

**Must include:**

- At least one variable (displayed on screen)

- At least one conditional statement

- Clear way to play

- Beginning and end state

**Teacher circulates:**

- "What variable are you using?"

- "What's your condition?"

- "How do I win?"

**Debugging support:**

- "What should happen?"

- "What's actually happening?"

- "Where might the problem be?"

### Testing & Sharing (6 min)
**Pair testing:**

- Play your partner's game

- Give feedback: "I liked... One idea is..."

**Quick shares:** 2-3 students demo their games.

### Reflection & Closing (2 min)
**Reflect:**

- "What was hardest about using variables/conditionals?"

- "What would you add with more time?"

**Faith Connection:** "Blessed Carlo Acutis showed us that coding can be used for God's glory. He didn't just play games — he created things to help people know Jesus. How might YOU use your programming skills to help others?"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank you, God, for the gift of logic and creativity. Help us use our skills — in coding and in life — to serve You and others. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We learned intermediate Scratch programming! Ask your child to show you their game at scratch.mit.edu. Ask: 'What variables did you use?' 'How do the conditions work?' Encourage them to explore Scratch at home — it's free! Talk about how Blessed Carlo Acutis used technology for good."
