# Weeks 7-9: Engineering Design: Community Helpers

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Catholic Social Teaching: Preferential Option for the Poor** — Jesus calls us to care especially for the vulnerable. Engineers and inventors can use their skills to help people in need. When we design with others' needs in mind, we live out our faith.

### Scripture Connection
> "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
> — Matthew 25:40

### Saint Connection
**St. Damien of Molokai** — He lived among people with leprosy, serving their needs when no one else would. He built houses, roads, and a water system for the colony. He used practical skills to serve Christ in the poor.

# Session 1: Empathize & Define

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Loving God, open our eyes to see the needs around us. Give us creative minds to design solutions and generous hearts to serve others. Help us see Your face in everyone we help. Amen."

**Read Matthew 25:40:** "Whatever you did for one of the least of these... you did for me."

**Discuss:**

- "Who are 'the least of these' in our community?"

- "What needs do people have?"

- "How can engineers help?"

### Design Challenges Introduction (10 min)
**Present community design challenges (choose one for class or let teams choose):**

**Challenge A: Clean Water Helper**

- Problem: Some communities don't have access to clean water

- Design: Create a simple water filter using available materials

- Test: Filter muddy water and compare clarity

**Challenge B: Shelter Solution**

- Problem: Homeless people need protection from weather

- Design: Create a portable shelter model that is waterproof and insulated

- Test: Test for water resistance and stability

**Challenge C: Accessibility Aid**

- Problem: People with mobility challenges face barriers

- Design: Create a device that helps with daily tasks

- Test: Based on specific device function

**Challenge D: Emergency Light**

- Problem: After disasters, people need light without electricity

- Design: Create a light source that doesn't require batteries

- Test: Brightness and duration

### Empathy Research (10 min)
**Research phase:**

- What do we know about this problem?

- Who experiences this need?

- What solutions already exist?

- What are the requirements for a good solution?

**Create empathy map:**

- Who are we designing for?

- What do they need?

- What challenges do they face?

- What would help them most?

### Define the Problem (10 min)
**Problem statement:**
Teams write a clear problem statement:
"We are designing _____________ for _____________ because _____________."

**Design requirements:**

- What MUST your design do? (constraints)

- What would be NICE if it could do? (criteria)

- What materials are available?

**Share problem statements** with class.

### Closing & Preparation (5 min)
**Faith Connection:** "St. Damien didn't just feel sorry for people with leprosy — he DID something. He built and created and served. That's what we're doing: using our skills to serve others."

**Homework thinking:** "Think about your design before next session!"

# Session 2: Ideate & Build

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "Creator God, You gave us imagination and creativity. Help us use these gifts today to design solutions that help others. Guide our hands and minds. Amen."

**Review:** "What problem is your team solving? Who are you helping?"

### Brainstorm Solutions (8 min)
**Individual brainstorm (3 min):**

- Each team member sketches 2-3 possible solutions

- No ideas are bad ideas!

- Think creatively

**Team brainstorm (5 min):**

- Share individual ideas

- Combine ideas

- Select one design to prototype

- Why did you choose this design?

### Design Planning (5 min)
**Detailed design sketch:**

- Draw your design with labels

- List materials needed

- Identify potential challenges

- Plan for testing

### Build Prototype (18 min)
**Building time!**

**Teacher circulates:**

- "How does this address the need?"

- "What's working?"

- "What challenges are you facing?"

**Encourage iteration:**

- It's okay to change your design!

- Learn from what doesn't work

- Ask for help when stuck

**Checkpoint questions:**

- "Does this meet your requirements?"

- "How will you test it?"

### Closing & Preview (5 min)
**Quick share:** Each team shows prototype progress.

**Faith Connection:** "Even if our prototypes aren't perfect, we're practicing something important: caring about others' needs and trying to help. That's at the heart of being Catholic!"

**Preview:** "Next session, we'll test, improve, and present our designs!"

# Session 3: Test, Iterate & Present

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (3 min)
**Prayer:** "Lord, help us test with honesty, improve with perseverance, and present with clarity. May our work honor You and serve others. Amen."

### Testing Phase (10 min)
**Test designs** based on criteria:

- Water filter: Does it filter? How clear is the output?

- Shelter: Is it waterproof? Stable?

- Accessibility aid: Does it work as intended?

- Emergency light: How bright? How long?

**Record results:**

- What worked well?

- What didn't work as planned?

- What could be improved?

### Iteration Phase (10 min)
**Improve designs based on testing:**

- Make modifications

- Test again if possible

- Document changes and improvements

**Questions to consider:**

- "What one change would most improve your design?"

- "How does this change address the problem better?"

### Presentation Preparation (5 min)
**Prepare brief presentation:**
1. The problem we're solving (who we're helping)
2. Our design solution (how it works)
3. Testing results (evidence it works)
4. What we learned (improvements)

### Presentations (10 min)
**Teams present (2 min each):**

- Demonstrate design

- Share testing results

- Explain faith connection

**Audience response:**

- One thing you like about this design

- One question about the design

### Closing Celebration (2 min)
**Faith Connection:** "Whether or not our designs are perfect, we practiced something essential today: thinking about others' needs before our own wants. Jesus calls us to serve 'the least of these' — and you've begun learning how to use your God-given skills to do exactly that!"

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for creative minds and caring hearts. Help us always use our talents to serve others. May we see Your face in everyone who needs help. Amen."
