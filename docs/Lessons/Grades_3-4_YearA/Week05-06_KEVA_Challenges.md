# Weeks 5-6: KEVA Engineering Challenges

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Building God's Kingdom** — The Bible is full of building stories — Noah's Ark, Solomon's Temple, and even the Tower of Babel. What we build and WHY we build matters. When we use our skills to serve others and glorify God, our work has eternal value.

### Scripture Connection
> "Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain."
> — Psalm 127:1

### Saint Connection
**St. Barbara** — Patron saint of architects and builders. Legend says she had a third window added to her tower to represent the Trinity. Engineers throughout history have built structures to honor God.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- KEVA planks (200+ per group)

- Measuring tapes and rulers

- Challenge cards with specifications

- Testing weights

- Recording sheets

- Timer

# Session 1: Tower Challenge

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Introduction (5 min)
**Prayer:** "Master Builder, You designed the universe with wisdom and care. Help us build with creativity and cooperation today. May our work reflect Your glory. Amen."

**Story connection:** Brief discussion of Tower of Babel (Genesis 11)

- "What went wrong with the Tower of Babel?"

- "It wasn't that they built — it's WHY and HOW they built"

- "Today, we'll build to learn and help each other"

### Engineering Challenge Introduction (5 min)
**Tower Challenge specifications:**

- Build the tallest tower possible

- Must stand for 10 seconds without support

- Must fit within 12" x 12" base area

- Only KEVA planks allowed

**Constraints:**

- Time limit: 15 minutes

- Must be able to explain your design choices

**Discuss:**

- "What makes towers strong?"

- "What engineering strategies might help?"

- Wide base, triangles, weight distribution

### Design & Plan (5 min)
**Teams plan before building:**

- Sketch basic design

- Discuss strategy with team

- Assign roles (builder, measurer, etc.)

### Building Challenge (15 min)
**Build time!**

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Tell me about your design"

- "What's making it stable?"

- "What would you change?"

**Checkpoints:**

- 5 min: "How's your foundation?"

- 10 min: "What adjustments are you making?"

- 14 min: "One minute to finalize!"

### Testing & Measurement (7 min)
**Test each tower:**

- Start timer when hands are removed

- Must stand 10 seconds

- Measure height of successful towers

**Record results** on class chart.

**Discussion:**

- "What strategies worked?"

- "What caused failures?"

- "What would you try differently?"

### Closing (3 min)
**Faith Connection:** "Building takes patience and teamwork. The builders of the great cathedrals worked for generations — they knew they might never see the finished building. That's faith! What we start can continue beyond us."

**Preview:** "Next time, we'll build bridges with even more constraints!"

# Session 2: Bridge Challenge

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer & Review (4 min)
**Prayer:** "God of all creation, You are the bridge between heaven and earth. Help us build bridges today — structures that connect and support. Amen."

**Review:** "What did we learn about building towers?"

### Bridge Challenge Introduction (6 min)
**Bridge Challenge specifications:**

- Must span a 12-inch gap

- Must hold at least 1 pound of weight

- Structure cannot touch the "water" below

- Only KEVA planks allowed

**Additional constraint:** Limited materials — only 75 planks per team!

**Discuss bridge types:**

- Beam bridges (flat across)

- Arch bridges (curved support)

- Truss bridges (triangular support)

**Question:** "With limited materials, which design might be most efficient?"

### Design Phase (5 min)
**Teams plan:**

- Consider bridge type

- Plan material usage

- Sketch design

- Discuss weight distribution

### Building Challenge (15 min)
**Build time with limited materials!**

**Teacher support:**

- "How are you managing your plank budget?"

- "Where does the weight need to go?"

- "How are you distributing force?"

**Material management:**

- Teams must count and track planks

- No "borrowing" from other teams

- Strategy matters!

### Testing & Analysis (7 min)
**Load testing:**

- Place bridges across 12" gap

- Add weight gradually

- Record maximum weight held

**Record and compare:**

- Which designs held the most?

- How did different teams use their 75 planks?

- What's the relationship between design and strength?

**Math integration:**

- Calculate efficiency: weight held ÷ planks used

- Compare ratios across teams

### Reflection & Closing (3 min)
**Discussion:**

- "How did the material constraint change your approach?"

- "What did you learn about bridge design?"

**Faith Connection:** "In life, we often have constraints — limited time, resources, or abilities. But constraints can spark creativity! God uses our limitations to show His power and help us grow."

**Closing Prayer:** "Thank You, God, for the gift of engineering. Help us use our skills to build bridges — not just of wood and stone, but bridges of understanding, friendship, and love. Amen."

## ✅ Assessment

### Session 1

- Built tower meeting specifications

- Used engineering strategies (wide base, structural elements)

- Collaborated effectively with team

### Session 2

- Built bridge meeting span and weight requirements

- Worked within material constraints

- Calculated and compared efficiency

---

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We were structural engineers! Ask your child: 'What made your tower/bridge strong?' 'How did you work within constraints?' Build together at home — try building a bridge from cardboard that can hold a small toy. Discuss how working with limits helps us be creative!"
