# Week 18: Growth Goals

### Scripture Connection
> "And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man."
> — Luke 2:52

### Saint Connection
**Bl. Pier Giorgio Frassati** — A young man who set goals for growing in faith and helping others. He worked hard at school AND at being kind. He shows us to grow in ALL areas.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Dear God, You helped Jesus grow in wisdom and love. Help us grow this year too — not just taller, but kinder, smarter, and closer to You. Show us how to set good goals. Amen."

### Introduction: Growing in Every Way (5 min)
**Growth conversation:**

- "How do you know you're growing?" (taller, bigger shoes, learning more)

- "You grow in ways you can SEE and ways you CAN'T see"

**Luke 2:52 — Jesus grew in:**

- **Wisdom** — Learning and understanding

- **Stature** — Body growing

- **Favor with God** — Faith and prayer

- **Favor with man** — Kindness and friendship

**All four matter!**

**Bl. Pier Giorgio:**

- "He was a student who worked hard at school"

- "He was also very kind and helped poor people"

- "He loved to climb mountains AND pray"

- "He grew in EVERY way!"

### Measuring Physical Growth (5 min)
**Quick measurement activity:**

- Measure heights (or hands, or shoe length)

- Record numbers

- "We'll measure again later to see growth!"

**Math connection:**

- "Numbers help us track change"

- "We can SEE growth when we measure"

### Setting Growth Goals (12 min)
**Four goal areas (matching Jesus):**

**1. Learning Goal (Wisdom):**

- "What do you want to LEARN this year?"

- Examples: Learn to read better, learn math facts, learn about animals

- Write or draw goal

**2. Body Goal (Stature):**

- "How will you take care of your body?"

- Examples: Run faster, eat healthy foods, get enough sleep

- Write or draw goal

**3. Faith Goal (Favor with God):**

- "How will you grow closer to God?"

- Examples: Pray every day, learn a new prayer, listen at Mass

- Write or draw goal

**4. Kindness Goal (Favor with People):**

- "How will you be kind to others?"

- Examples: Share more, include someone lonely, help at home

- Write or draw goal

**Create goal page:**

- Decorate!

### Growth Tracker (4 min)
**Simple tracker:**

- Chart or sticker system

- "Growth takes TIME and PRACTICE"

**Plant connection (if available):**

- Plant a seed together

- "Just like this seed will grow, YOU will grow!"

- "We'll watch it and watch ourselves grow too"

### Closing (2 min)
**Encouragement:**

- "Growing takes time — be patient with yourself"

- "God is always helping you grow"

- "Even when it's hard, keep trying!"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for helping us grow. Help us keep our goals and become more like Jesus — wise, healthy, faithful, and kind. When we struggle, help us try again. We trust You to help us grow. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
