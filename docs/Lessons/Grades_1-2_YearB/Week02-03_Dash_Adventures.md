# Weeks 2-3: Dash Robot Adventures

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Human Creativity** — God is the Creator, and we are made in His image. When we create programs, build robots, and solve problems, we reflect God's creative nature. We are co-creators with God!

### Scripture Connection
> "So God created mankind in his own image."
> — Genesis 1:27

### Saint Connection
**Bl. Solanus Casey** — Known for his patience and kindness. When our programs don't work, we practice patience like Bl. Solanus, trying again with a gentle spirit.

# Session 1: Meet Dash!

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Dear God, You are the great Creator. Thank You for giving us creative minds. Help us learn to program Dash today. Give us patience when things are hard. Amen."

### Introduction: Meet Dash! (8 min)
**Explore Dash:**

- What does Dash look like?

- Find: head, wheels, eye, buttons

- How does Dash move? (three wheels!)

**Dash can:**

- Move (forward, backward, turn)

- Light up (eye and ears)

- Make sounds

- Sense things nearby

**Key concept: Programming**

- "A PROGRAM is a set of instructions"

- "Dash doesn't know what to do until WE tell it"

- "We're like teachers — we have to be very clear!"

**Robot rules:**

- Gentle with Dash

- Take turns

- Stay in designated area

- Listen for stop signal

### First Program: Move! (15 min)
**Open Blockly app:**

- Find "Drive" blocks

- Snap together: Forward → Forward → Stop

**Test:**

- Does Dash do what you expected?

- How far does one "Forward" go?

**Challenge levels:**
1. Make Dash go forward and stop
2. Make Dash go forward, turn, go forward
3. Make Dash go in a square path

**Teacher circulates:**

- "What did you tell Dash to do?"

- "Did it work? What happened?"

- "What will you try next?"

### Closing (5 min)
**Clean up procedure:**

- Properly dock robots

- Save programs

- Exit app properly

**Reflection:**

- What was easy?

- What was tricky?

- What do you want to try next time?

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for creative minds that can program robots. Help us keep learning and never give up. Amen."

# Session 2: Dash Adventures

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Dear God, help us work together today. Give us patience like Bl. Solanus Casey when things are difficult. Help us solve problems and help each other. Amen."

### Review & New Skills (5 min)
**Quick review:**

- How do we make Dash move?

- What's a program?

**New blocks:**

- Lights (change eye color)

- Sounds (play sounds)

- Loops (repeat actions)

### Adventure Challenges (18 min)
**Set up adventure courses:**

**Challenge 1: Visit a Friend**

- Program Dash to travel from start to a "friend" (stuffed animal)

- Must stop at the friend

**Challenge 2: Light Show**

- Program Dash to change colors while moving

- Make a "dance" with lights

**Challenge 3: Sound Journey**

- Add sounds to Dash's adventure

- Make a story with movement and sound

**Partner work:**

- One person programs

- One person observes

- Switch roles

- Help each other

### Debugging Practice (3 min)
**When it doesn't work:**
1. Watch carefully — what DOES happen?
2. Think — what did we TELL Dash to do?
3. Find the problem block
4. Fix and try again

**Bl. Solanus connection:**

- "He was patient even when things were hard"

- "We practice patience when we debug"

- "It's okay to make mistakes — that's how we learn!"

### Closing (2 min)
**Share one success:**

- What did your Dash adventure look like?

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for robots and programming. Thank You for patience when things don't work. Help us keep creating and exploring. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We programmed Dash Robots! Ask your child: 'What is a program?' 'What did you make Dash do?' 'What happened when it didn't work?' We learned that debugging (fixing problems) takes patience, like Bl. Solanus Casey showed us. Practice patience at home too!"

---

## ✅ Assessment

- Identified Dash robot parts

- Created simple programs with Blockly

- Worked cooperatively with partner

- Showed patience when debugging
