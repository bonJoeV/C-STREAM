# Weeks 7-9: Animal Habitats

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Stewardship of Creation** — God gave humans responsibility to care for animals and the earth. Designing habitats helps us understand what animals need so we can protect them.

### Scripture Connection
> "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."
> — Genesis 2:15

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — Patron of animals who called creatures his brothers and sisters. He teaches us to respect and care for all living things.

# Session 1: Animal Needs

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"St. Francis, you loved all animals as brothers and sisters. Help us learn about animals today so we can care for them better. Teach us to be good stewards of God's creatures. Amen."

**Research questions:**
1. What does your animal EAT?
2. What does your animal DRINK?
3. Where does your animal LIVE?
4. What keeps your animal SAFE?
5. Does it need special temperature or space?

**Record on planning sheet:**

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We designed animal habitats! Ask your child: 'What animal did you research?' 'What four things do animals need?' 'How did you include them in your habitat?' We learned about St. Francis and caring for creation. Consider putting up a bird feeder or planting flowers for bees as a family stewardship project!"
