# Week 11: Thanksgiving Coding

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gratitude as Prayer** — Thanking God is one of the four types of prayer (praise, thanksgiving, contrition, petition). When we count our blessings and express gratitude, we're praying!

### Scripture Connection
> "Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever."
> — Psalm 107:1

### Saint Connection
**St. Thérèse of Lisieux** — Found joy in small things and was constantly grateful. Her "Little Way" teaches us to thank God for everyday blessings.
