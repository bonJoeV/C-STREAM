# Week 4: Senses & Discovery

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gift of the Body** — Our bodies are gifts from God, including our senses. Through our senses we experience the beauty of creation — the colors of flowers, the sounds of birds, the taste of food. Our senses help us know and love God's world.

### Scripture Connection
> "I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made."
> — Psalm 139:14

### Saint Connection
**St. Isidore the Farmer** — A farmer who used his senses daily — watching the sky for weather, feeling the soil, listening to animals. He found God through working with creation.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Dear God, thank You for our amazing bodies. Thank You for eyes to see, ears to hear, hands to touch, noses to smell, and tongues to taste. Help us use our senses today to discover more about Your wonderful creation. Amen."

### Introduction: Our Five Senses (5 min)
**Review the five senses:**

- 👁️ Sight — What can we SEE?

- 👂 Hearing — What can we HEAR?

- 🖐️ Touch — What can we FEEL?

- 👃 Smell — What can we SMELL?

- 👅 Taste — What can we TASTE?

**Scientists use ALL senses:**

- "Careful observation uses our senses"

- "Today we'll practice using EACH sense carefully"

- "Like St. Isidore, we'll explore God's world"

### Sense Stations (18 min)
**Rotate through stations (3-4 min each):**

**Station 1: Mystery Touch Box**

- Reach in without looking

- Describe what you feel

- Can you guess what it is?

- Words to use: smooth, rough, bumpy, soft, hard, fuzzy

**Station 2: Sound Shakers**

- Shake mystery containers

- Match containers that sound the same

- Describe sounds: loud, soft, rattly, jingly, swishy

**Station 3: Looking Closely**

- Use magnifying glasses

- Observe natural objects

- Draw what you see in detail

- How many colors? What shapes?

**Station 4: Smell Discovery**

- Safely smell containers (not too close!)

- Describe smells: sweet, fresh, strong, yucky

- Can you identify any smells?

**Station 5: Texture Art** (if time)

- Create texture rubbings

- Compare different textures

- Which is roughest? Smoothest?

### Recording & Sharing (3 min)
**Record on sense sheet:**

- One thing I saw: ________

- One thing I heard: ________

- One thing I felt: ________

- One thing I smelled: ________

**Share discoveries:**

- What was most surprising?

- Which sense told you the most?

### Closing (2 min)
**Gratitude reflection:**

- "Our senses are GIFTS from God"

- "Some people can't see or hear — be thankful!"

- "How can you use your senses to enjoy God's world today?"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for my wonderful body. Thank You for senses that help me experience Your creation. Help me notice the beautiful things around me — the sounds, sights, smells, and textures of Your world. Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We explored our five senses as scientific tools today! Ask your child: 'What did you discover with each sense?' 'Which sense surprised you?' We learned that St. Isidore the Farmer used his senses to care for creation. Go on a 'sense walk' together — what can you see, hear, feel, and smell outside?"
