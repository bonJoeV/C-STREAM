# Weeks 19-22: Invention Labs

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Human Creativity** — Made in God's image, we share in His creativity. Inventors use their God-given imagination to solve problems and help others. When we create, we reflect our Creator!

### Scripture Connection
