# Weeks 29-31: Butterfly Engineering

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Resurrection and Transformation** — The caterpillar becomes a butterfly through amazing transformation. This mirrors our Easter faith: death leads to new life. We too will be transformed!

### Scripture Connection
> "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"
> — 2 Corinthians 5:17

### Saint Connection
**St. Paul** — Experienced dramatic transformation from persecutor to apostle. Like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, God transformed him completely.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- Butterfly life cycle kit (if available)

- Life cycle images/diagrams

- Craft materials (paper, pipe cleaners)

- Observation journals

- Chrysalis/cocoon materials

# Session 1: Amazing Metamorphosis

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Dear God, You created butterflies with their amazing transformation. Help us learn about metamorphosis today and see Your power to make all things new. Amen."

### Introduction: Transformation! (8 min)
**Show caterpillar and butterfly images:**

- "Are these the same creature?"

- "How is that POSSIBLE?"

- "It's called METAMORPHOSIS!"

**The four stages:**
1. 🥚 **Egg** — Tiny beginning
2. 🐛 **Caterpillar (Larva)** — Eating and growing
3. 🤎 **Chrysalis (Pupa)** — Transformation happens!
4. 🦋 **Butterfly (Adult)** — Beautiful new form!

**The mystery of the chrysalis:**

- "Inside, everything changes"

- "It looks like nothing is happening"

- "But TRANSFORMATION is happening!"

**Faith connection:**

- "This is like Easter!"

- "Jesus died (like entering the chrysalis)"

- "Then He rose — transformed, alive, beautiful!"

- "We will be transformed too!"

### Life Cycle Observation (12 min)
**If live caterpillars available:**

- Observe caterpillars

- What do you notice?

- Draw observations in journal

**If using images:**

- Examine each stage closely

- Compare sizes, colors, features

- Sort life cycle cards in order

**Journal recording:**

- Draw the four stages

- Label each stage

- Write one fact about each

### Story of St. Paul (5 min)
**Transformation story:**

- "Saul was mean to Christians"

- "He met Jesus and was completely changed"

- "He became PAUL — a new person!"

- "Like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly"

**Personal connection:**

- "God can transform us too"

- "He can help us become better, kinder, more loving"

- "We're all in process — like caterpillars!"

### Closing (3 min)
**Wonder question:**
"If you could transform into anything, what would it be? What does God want to transform in your heart?"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for butterflies that show us transformation is possible. Transform us too — make us more like Jesus, more loving and kind. Amen."

# Session 2: Chrysalis Engineering

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Lord, You do Your best work in hidden places — like inside a chrysalis. Help us trust that You're working in us too, even when we can't see it. Amen."

### Observation Check (3 min)
**If live caterpillars:**

- Any changes?

- Document observations

- What do you predict will happen next?

### Engineering Challenge: Build a Life Cycle Model (22 min)
**Challenge:** Create a 3D model showing all four butterfly stages!

**Materials:**

- Paper and cardstock

- Pipe cleaners

- Cotton balls

- Tissue paper

- Markers/crayons

**Model requirements:**
1. Show all FOUR stages
2. Make them look accurate
3. Arrange in order
4. Be creative!

**Building ideas:**

- Egg: Tiny ball of paper or clay

- Caterpillar: Pipe cleaner, paper tube, or drawn

- Chrysalis: Cotton ball, brown tissue paper wrapped

- Butterfly: Paper wings, pipe cleaner body

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Which stage is this?"

- "What happens next?"

- "What colors do butterflies have?"

### Share Models (3 min)
**Quick show:**

- Hold up your model

- Point to each stage

- Tell what transformation happens

**Celebrate creativity!**

### Closing (2 min)
**Faith reminder:**
"Sometimes we feel stuck — like we're in a chrysalis. But God is working! Trust the process!"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You for time to create today. Help us remember that transformation takes time. Be patient with us, Lord, as You make us new. Amen."

# Session 3: Butterfly Celebration

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Dear God, thank You for butterflies and transformation. Help us celebrate new life today! Amen."

### Observation Report (5 min)
**If live butterflies:**

- Observe emerged butterflies!

- What do you notice?

- How are they different from caterpillars?

**If using images:**

- Review the complete journey

- Watch video of butterfly emerging (if available)

**Document final observations in journal.**

### Butterfly Art Creation (15 min)
**Create butterfly art:**

**Option A: Symmetry Butterfly**

- Fold paper in half

- Paint on one side

- Fold and press

- Open for symmetrical butterfly!

**Option B: Coffee Filter Butterfly**

- Color with markers

- Spray with water

- Let colors blend

- Scrunch middle with pipe cleaner for body

**Option C: Tissue Paper Butterfly**

- Layer tissue paper

- Accordion fold

- Pinch in middle

- Spread wings

**While creating:**

- "Your butterfly is unique!"

- "God makes beautiful things"

- "We are being transformed into beautiful new creations too!"

### Celebration & Release (6 min)
**If live butterflies:**

- Go outside for release (weather permitting)

- Say a prayer for the butterflies

- Watch them fly!

**If no live butterflies:**

- Display butterfly art

- Gallery walk

- Celebrate transformation

**Faith celebration:**

- "The caterpillar didn't know what it would become"

- "But God knew!"

- "God knows what YOU will become too"

- "Trust Him with your transformation!"

### Closing (2 min)
**Final reflection:**

- "What did you learn about butterflies?"

- "What did you learn about transformation?"

- "How is God transforming you?"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for the miracle of butterflies. Thank You for resurrection and new life. Transform us, Lord, into the beautiful people You created us to be. Help us fly! Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We studied butterfly metamorphosis and connected it to Easter transformation! Ask your child: 'What are the four stages of a butterfly life cycle?' 'How is metamorphosis like resurrection?' 'What is God transforming in you?' Look for butterflies together this spring and remember: transformation is possible!"

---

## ✅ Assessment
