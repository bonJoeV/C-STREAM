# Weeks 26-27: Garden Engineering

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Spiritual Growth** — Just like plants need sun, water, and soil, our faith needs nourishment too — prayer, Mass, kindness. Jesus often used plant parables to teach about faith.

### Scripture Connection
> "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow."
> — 1 Corinthians 3:6

### Saint Connection
**St. Fiacre** — Patron saint of gardeners who saw gardening as prayer. He cared for God's creation and fed the poor from his garden.
