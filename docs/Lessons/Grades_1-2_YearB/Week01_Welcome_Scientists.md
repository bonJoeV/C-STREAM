# Week 1: Welcome Back Scientists

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Wonder at Creation** — God made the world and called it "good." Scientists explore this good creation, discovering its beauty and order. When we observe nature carefully, we see God's handiwork.

### Scripture Connection
> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."
> — Psalm 19:1

### Saint Connection
**St. Kateri Tekakwitha** — A Native American saint who loved nature and saw God in the forests, rivers, and animals. She teaches us to find God in creation.
