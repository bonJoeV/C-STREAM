# Week 23: Catholic Schools Celebration

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Catholic Education** — Catholic schools teach faith AND reason together. STREAM shows that science and faith are partners, not enemies. We celebrate learning about God's world!

### Scripture Connection
> "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it."
> — Proverbs 22:6

### Saint Connection
**St. Elizabeth Ann Seton** — Founded the first Catholic school in America. She believed education should include both learning and faith.
