# Week 12: Gifts for Others

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gift of Self** — The best gifts are those that give of ourselves — our time, effort, and love. Handmade gifts show we value the person enough to invest ourselves.

### Scripture Connection
> "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."
> — 2 Corinthians 9:7

### Saint Connection
**St. Nicholas** — Famous for giving gifts in secret. He gave to those in need without expecting anything in return. He inspires our gift-giving at Christmas.

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (30 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Dear God, help us be cheerful givers today. As we make gifts for others, fill us with love. Help us think about what would make someone else happy. Amen."

### Introduction: Giving Gifts (4 min)
**St. Nicholas story:**

- "He gave gifts to people in need"

- "He gave SECRETLY — didn't want thanks"

- "He shows us how to be generous"

**Handmade gifts are special:**

- "When you MAKE something, you give your TIME"

- "That's more valuable than money!"

- "Thinking about what someone else wants = LOVE"

**Today's challenge:**

- Make a gift for someone you care about

- Think: What would THEY like?

- Not what YOU like — what THEY like!

### Planning Phase (5 min)
**Think about your recipient:**

- Who will you give this to?

- What do they like?

- What colors do they enjoy?

- What would make them smile?

**Choose your project:**

**Option A: Bookmark**

- For someone who reads

- Personalize with colors they like

**Option B: Picture Frame**

- Made from craft sticks

- Decorate for them

- They can add a photo

**Option C: Decoration**

- Ornament or hanging art

- For their room or tree

**Option D: Card with Art**

- Special handmade card

- Include a drawing for them

### Making Phase (15 min)
**Create your gift!**

**Design thinking reminders:**

- "Is this what THEY would like?"

- "Are you using THEIR favorite colors?"

- "Would this make THEM smile?"

**Craftsmanship matters:**

- Take your time

- Do your best work

- This shows you care!

**Teacher circulates:**

- "Who is this for?"

- "What do they like about it?"

- "How will they use it?"

### Closing (4 min)
**Wrap it up:**

- Simple wrapping if time allows

- Write "To: ___" and "From: ___"

**Sharing:**

- "Who is your gift for?"

- "What did you think about while making it?"

**St. Nicholas connection:**

- "He gave without wanting thanks"

- "Can you give this gift and not brag about it?"

- "Let the GIFT show your love, not your words"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for people we love. Thank You for the ability to make things with our hands. Help us be cheerful givers like St. Nicholas. May our gifts bring joy to others. Amen."
