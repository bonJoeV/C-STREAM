# Weeks 8-10: Biomimicry Design

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Learning from Creation** — When we study nature's designs, we're studying God's engineering. Every adaptation, every solution already exists in creation. Biomimicry is humbly learning from the Master Designer!

### Scripture Connection
> "But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds in the sky, and they will tell you."
> — Job 12:7

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — Patron of ecology who called all creatures his brothers and sisters. He saw God's presence in all nature. His Canticle of Creation praises Brother Sun and Sister Moon. Francis teaches us to learn from and respect all life.

## 📝 Week 8 Procedure: Introduction to Biomimicry (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"St. Francis, pray for us! Help us learn from our brothers and sisters in nature. Creator God, open our eyes to see Your wisdom in every creature. May we design with humility, learning from Your creation. Amen."

### What is Biomimicry? (10 min)
**Nature as teacher:**

**Definition:**

- Bio = life

- Mimicry = imitation

- Biomimicry = Learning from nature to solve human problems

**Key concept:**
"Nature has 3.8 billion years of R&D. Why reinvent the wheel when creation already has solutions?"

**St. Francis connection:**

- Saw all nature as family

- Respected creatures' wisdom

- Learned spiritual lessons from nature

- "If you have men who will exclude any of God's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity, you will have men who will deal likewise with their fellow men."

### Amazing Biomimicry Examples (15 min)
**Real-world applications:**

**1. Velcro (Burrs)**

- Inventor walked dog through field

- Burrs stuck to dog's fur

- Examined hooks under microscope

- Created hook-and-loop fastener!

**2. Bullet Train (Kingfisher)**

- Japanese train was loud entering tunnels

- Engineer was birdwatcher

- Kingfisher enters water silently

- Copied beak shape → quieter, faster train!

**3. Gecko Tape (Gecko feet)**

- Geckos walk on walls and ceilings

- Tiny hairs create adhesion

- Scientists copied → reusable adhesive!

**4. Swimsuits (Shark skin)**

- Shark skin has tiny ridges

- Reduces drag in water

- Olympic swimsuits copied design

**5. Self-cleaning surfaces (Lotus leaf)**

- Lotus leaves stay clean in muddy water

- Microscopic bumps repel water and dirt

- Copied for building materials, paints

**Discussion:**

- "What's surprising about these examples?"

- "Why didn't humans think of these first?"

- "What does this tell us about nature's design?"

### Nature Observation (15 min)
**Looking for design inspiration:**

**Observation activity:**
Go outside OR use images/specimens

**Observe and record:**

- Choose one plant or animal

- Draw it carefully

- List its special features

- What problems does it solve?

- What challenges does it overcome?

**Guiding questions:**

- How does it protect itself?

- How does it get food/water?

- How does it move?

- How does it survive extreme conditions?

- What's unique about its structure?

**Share observations:**

- What did you notice?

- What adaptation impressed you?

- What human problem might this inspire?

### Closing (3 min)
**Preview:**
"Next week we'll research specific adaptations and start designing our own biomimicry inventions!"

**Journal prompt:**

- "What creature did you observe?"

- "What problem does its adaptation solve?"

- "What human problem might it address?"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, Creator, for 3.8 billion years of design wisdom! Thank You for creatures that teach us. Help us be humble learners from Your creation. St. Francis, pray that we respect and learn from all our brothers and sisters in nature. Amen."

## 📝 Week 9 Procedure: Research & Design (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Lord of all creation, guide our research today! Help us discover Your wisdom in the designs of nature. May we create solutions that serve others. Amen."

### Adaptation Research (20 min)
**Deep dive into nature's solutions:**

**Research stations (groups rotate):**

**Station 1: Movement & Locomotion**

- How do dolphins swim efficiently?

- How do birds fly with minimum energy?

- How do snakes move without legs?

- How do insects walk on water?

**Station 2: Materials & Structures**

- How do spider webs combine strength and flexibility?

- How do bones combine lightness and strength?

- How do shells protect?

- How do honeycombs maximize space?

**Station 3: Thermal Regulation**

- How do polar bears stay warm?

- How do elephants stay cool?

- How do termite mounds regulate temperature?

- How do desert animals manage heat?

**Station 4: Water Management**

- How do cacti store water?

- How do beetles collect water from fog?

- How do mangroves filter salt?

- How do lotus leaves repel water?

**At each station:**

- Read information cards

- Study images/videos

- Record key adaptations

- Brainstorm human applications

### Problem Selection (10 min)
**Choose your focus:**

**Human problems that could use nature's help:**

- Clean water access

- Building efficiency

- Transportation
