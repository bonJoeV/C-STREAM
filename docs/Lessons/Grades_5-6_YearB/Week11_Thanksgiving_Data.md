# Week 11: Thanksgiving Data

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Counting Blessings** — When we quantify our blessings, we see God's generosity more clearly. Data science becomes a tool for gratitude, helping us recognize patterns of grace in our lives.

### Scripture Connection
> "Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances."
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18

### Saint Connection
**St. Ignatius of Loyola** — Created the Daily Examen, a practice of reviewing each day to find God's presence. This systematic reflection is like spiritual data collection — noticing patterns of grace!
