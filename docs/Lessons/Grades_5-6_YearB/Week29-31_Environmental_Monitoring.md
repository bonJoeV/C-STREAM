# Weeks 29-31: Environmental Monitoring

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Laudato Si' in Action** — Pope Francis calls us to care for our common home. Environmental monitoring is how we understand the problems. Data becomes a tool for justice and stewardship.

### Scripture Connection
> "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."
> — Genesis 2:15

### Faith Theme
**Stewardship through Science** — Good stewards need good information. Environmental monitoring gives us the data to make wise decisions. Science serves creation care!

## 📝 Week 29 Procedure: Environmental Data Collection (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Creator God, help us care for Your creation! Give us wisdom to understand our environment and courage to protect it. May our data serve Your world. Amen."

### Environmental Monitoring Introduction (10 min)
**Why monitor the environment?**

**Key concept:**
"You can't manage what you don't measure."

**What scientists monitor:**

- Air quality

- Water quality

- Temperature/climate

- Biodiversity

- Noise levels

- Light pollution

- Soil health

**Why it matters:**

- Identify problems

- Track changes over time

- Measure impact of solutions

- Provide evidence for action

**Laudato Si' connection:**
> "Each year sees the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species... The great majority become extinct for reasons related to human activity." (LS 33)

"We can't protect what we don't understand. Data is essential for stewardship!"

### Choose Monitoring Focus (8 min)
**Select environmental aspect:**

**Options:**

- School energy use

- Local air quality

- Water usage/quality

- Waste generation

- Biodiversity (species present)

- Noise/light pollution

- Green space

**For each option:**

- What data can we collect?

- What tools do we have?

- How long should we monitor?

- What might we discover?

**Teams form around interests**

### Data Collection Planning (15 min)
**Design monitoring protocol:**

**Protocol elements:**
1. **What** are we measuring?
2. **Where** are we measuring?

- Categorize (recycle, compost, landfill)

- Calculate averages

- Identify reduction opportunities

**Create data collection sheet:**

- Clear categories

- Easy to complete

- Includes date/time/collector

- Space for notes

### Begin Data Collection (8 min)
**Start your monitoring:**


- Collect first data point

- Test your protocol

- Note any issues

- Adjust as needed

**Assign ongoing collection:**

- Who collects when?

- Where is data stored?

- How do we ensure consistency?

### Closing (2 min)
**Homework:**
