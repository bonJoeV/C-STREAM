# Weeks 25-28: Health Technology

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Human Dignity in Healthcare** — Every person deserves care and healing. Medical technology should serve human dignity, especially for the vulnerable. Catholic healthcare is the largest private health system in the US!

### Scripture Connection
> "He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds."
> — Psalm 147:3

### Saint Connection
**St. Gianna Beretta Molla** — Modern saint (1922-1962) who was a pediatrician. She combined medical science with deep faith, treating the whole person. She sacrificed her life for her unborn child, showing the sanctity of all life.
