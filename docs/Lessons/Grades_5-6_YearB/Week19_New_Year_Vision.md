# Week 19: New Year Vision

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Vocation & Purpose** — God has a plan for each of us. Setting goals isn't just about achievement — it's about discerning and pursuing God's call in our lives. We use our gifts to serve His purposes.

### Scripture Connection
> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
> — Jeremiah 29:11

### Saint Connection
**St. Ignatius of Loyola** — Master of discernment, Ignatius created spiritual exercises to help people understand God's will. His approach combined prayer, reflection, and practical planning — faith and reason together!
