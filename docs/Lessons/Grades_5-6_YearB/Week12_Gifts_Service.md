# Week 12: Gifts of Service

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Preferential Option for the Poor** — Catholic Social Teaching calls us to prioritize those in need. When we design gifts that serve others, we use our talents as Jesus commanded — loving our neighbors.

### Scripture Connection
> "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
> — Matthew 25:40

### Saint Connection
**St. Vincent de Paul** — Patron of charitable organizations who dedicated his life to serving the poor. He organized systematic charity, not just individual acts. He saw Christ in every person he served.
