# Weeks 2-4: Biotechnology Basics

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**The Sanctity of Life** — As Catholics, we believe all life is sacred because it's created by God. Biotechnology can do great good (curing diseases, growing food) but must always respect the dignity of human life. Ethics matter!

### Scripture Connection
> "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made."
> — Psalm 139:13-14

### Saint Connection
**St. Hildegard of Bingen** — This 12th-century Benedictine abbess wrote extensively about natural science, medicine, and the human body. She saw understanding the body as understanding God's creation. She's now a Doctor of the Church!

## 📝 Week 2 Procedure: Cells — Building Blocks of Life (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Creator God, You designed every cell in our bodies with incredible wisdom! Help us learn about these tiny building blocks of life. St. Hildegard, who studied Your creation, pray for us! Amen."

### Introduction to Cells (10 min)
**The fundamental unit of life:**

**Key concepts:**

- All living things are made of cells

- Cells are microscopic — millions in a drop of blood!

- Cells do everything: eat, grow, reproduce, die

- Different cells have different jobs

**Cell types:**

- **Plant cells** — Have cell wall, chloroplasts

- **Animal cells** — No wall, can move

- **Bacteria** — Simple, no nucleus

**St. Hildegard connection:**

- Studied the body 900 years ago

- Didn't have microscopes!

- Still understood body's complexity

- "The human body is a universe in itself"

### Cell Structure (10 min)
**Parts of a cell:**

**Organelles:**

- **Cell membrane** — Outer boundary (security guard)

- **Nucleus** — Control center (brain)

- **Cytoplasm** — Gel inside (filling)

- **Mitochondria** — Power plants (batteries)

- **Ribosomes** — Protein factories

- **Endoplasmic reticulum** — Transport system

- **Golgi apparatus** — Packaging center

**Analogy: Cell as a city**

- Nucleus = City Hall

- Mitochondria = Power plants

- Membrane = City walls

- Ribosomes = Factories

### Cell Model Creation (20 min)
**Build edible or craft cell model:**

**Option A: Jello Cell**

- Jello = cytoplasm

- Large candy = nucleus

- Small candies = other organelles

- Gummy worms = ER

- Sprinkles = ribosomes

**Option B: Clay/Craft Model**

- Use modeling clay

- Different colors for organelles

- Label each part

**Requirements:**

- Include all major organelles

- Label each part

- Explain function of each

**While building:**

- "What's the most important organelle? Why?"

- "What happens if mitochondria stop working?"

- "How is a cell like a small factory?"

### Faith Reflection (3 min)
**Wonder and praise:**

**Discussion:**

- "Trillions of cells work together in your body RIGHT NOW"

- "Each cell has its own 'job'"

- "This complexity happened by chance? Or by design?"

**Psalm 139:**
"I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made."

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for the incredible design of cells! Thank You for giving us minds to study Your creation. Help us appreciate how wonderfully made we are. Amen."

## 📝 Week 3 Procedure: DNA — The Code of Life (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Lord of all creation, You wrote the code of life in DNA! Help us understand this amazing molecule. May our learning lead us to praise You. Amen."

### What is DNA? (10 min)
**The instruction manual of life:**

**Key concepts:**

- DNA = Deoxyribonucleic Acid

- Found in nucleus of every cell

- Contains instructions for building you!

- Shaped like a twisted ladder (double helix)

**DNA facts:**

- If you unraveled DNA from one cell, it would be 6 feet long!

- Your DNA is 99.9% identical to every other human

- That 0.1% makes you unique!

- DNA is a language with only 4 "letters": A, T, C, G

**Father of genetics:**

- Gregor Mendel discovered heredity

- Augustinian friar with faith and curiosity

- Paved the way for DNA discovery

### DNA Structure (8 min)
**Understanding the double helix:**

**Components:**

- **Sugar-phosphate backbone** — The rails of the ladder

- **Bases** — The rungs of the ladder
  - Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T)
  - Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G)

- **Genes** — Sections of DNA that code for traits

**How it works:**

- DNA → RNA → Protein

- Like recipe → instructions → dish

- Different genes = different traits

### DNA Extraction Lab (20 min)
**Extract DNA from strawberries!**

**Materials:**

- Strawberry (frozen works well)

- Dish soap

- Salt

- Cold isopropyl alcohol

- Ziplock bag

- Coffee filter

- Clear cup

**Procedure:**
1. Mush strawberry in bag (break cells)
2. Add extraction mixture (soap breaks membranes, salt clumps DNA)
3. Filter through coffee filter
4. Add cold alcohol slowly
5. Watch DNA precipitate!

**Observe:**

- DNA looks like white, stringy substance

- That's ACTUAL DNA!

- Same basic structure as human DNA

**Discussion during lab:**

- "Why does soap help?"

- "What makes DNA float in alcohol?"

- "Is strawberry DNA the same as yours?"

### Faith Connection (5 min)
**The language of life:**

**Reflection:**

- "DNA is a CODE — codes come from intelligence"

- "3 billion base pairs in human DNA"

- "More information than encyclopedias"

**Catholic teaching:**

- Science discovers HOW life works

- Faith tells us WHO designed it

- "In the beginning was the Word" — language, code, information

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for writing the code of life! Thank You for the gift of our unique DNA. Help us use what we learn to serve others and honor You. Amen."

## 📝 Week 4 Procedure: Biotechnology Applications & Ethics (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Wise God, give us wisdom as we explore biotechnology! Help us use science responsibly and ethically. May we always respect the sanctity of life. Amen."

### Biotechnology Overview (10 min)
**Using living things for technology:**

**What is biotechnology?**

- Using cells, DNA, organisms for human benefit

- Ancient: Bread, cheese, beer (yeast!)

- Modern: Genetic engineering, medicine, agriculture

**Applications:**

- **Medicine** — Insulin production, vaccines, gene therapy

- **Agriculture** — Drought-resistant crops, pest resistance

- **Environment** — Bacteria that clean oil spills

- **Industry** — Enzymes in detergent

**Catholic perspective:**

- Biotechnology can do great good

- BUT must always respect human dignity

- NOT everything possible is ethical

- We ask: "Should we?" not just "Can we?"

### Case Studies (15 min)
**Examine real biotechnology applications:**

**Case 1: Golden Rice**

- Rice engineered with Vitamin A

- Could prevent blindness in poor countries

- Debate: GMO concerns vs. saving lives

**Case 2: Gene Therapy**

- Fixing genetic diseases

- Great potential for healing

- Questions about "designer babies"

**Case 3: CRISPR**

- Tool to edit DNA precisely

- Could cure genetic diseases

- Concerns about editing human embryos

**For each case:**

- What's the technology?

- What good could it do?

- What concerns exist?

- What would the Church say?

### Catholic Ethics Framework (10 min)
**Evaluating biotechnology:**

**Key principles:**
1. **Human dignity** — Every person has inherent worth
2. **Sanctity of life** — Life is sacred from conception to death
3. **Common good** — Technology should serve everyone
4. **Stewardship** — We're caretakers, not owners
5. **Justice** — Benefits should be shared fairly

**Questions to ask:**

- Does this respect human dignity?

- Does this protect life?

- Who benefits? Who might be harmed?

- Are we playing God inappropriately?

- What would Jesus do?

**Church teaching:**

- Science is good and from God

- But science needs ethics

- Not everything possible is permissible

- Human life is not a commodity

### Position Statements (6 min)
**Write your view:**

**Choose one biotechnology:**

- Golden Rice

- Gene therapy

- Cloning (animals, not humans)

- Stem cell research

**Write:**

- 2-3 sentences explaining the technology

- Your position on it

- How Catholic ethics inform your view

**Share with partner:**

- Can you see both sides?

- What makes this complex?

### Closing (2 min)
**Synthesis:**

- Biotechnology is powerful

- Power requires responsibility

- Faith gives us an ethical framework

- We can appreciate science AND have values

**Closing Prayer:**
"God of wisdom, thank You for the power of biotechnology! Help us always use it wisely. Give us courage to stand for life and dignity even when it's hard. May we be scientists AND people of faith. St. Hildegard, pray for us! Amen."
