# Week 13: Advent Technology

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Technology for Good** — Technology is a tool that can draw us closer to God or distract us from Him. During Advent, we're challenged to use technology intentionally — for reflection, connection, and preparation rather than mindless consumption.

### Scripture Connection
> "Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths."
> — Mark 1:3

### Theme Connection
**Advent Themes:** Hope, Peace, Joy, Love — one for each week of waiting. Technology can help us reflect on these themes and share them with others.
