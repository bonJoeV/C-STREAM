# Weeks 20-23: Social Entrepreneurship

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Catholic Social Teaching** — Business should serve the common good, not just profit. Key principles include human dignity, solidarity, subsidiarity, and the preferential option for the poor. Social entrepreneurs use business to advance these values.

### Scripture Connection
> "What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?"
> — James 2:14

### Saint Connection
**Bl. Pier Giorgio Frassati** — Young Italian who used his family's wealth to serve the poor. He gave away his possessions and organized charity work. He showed that resources are meant to be shared. "Charity is not enough; we need social reform."
