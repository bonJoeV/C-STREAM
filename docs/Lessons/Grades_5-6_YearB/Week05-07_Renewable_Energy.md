# Weeks 5-7: Renewable Energy Lab

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Laudato Si'** — Pope Francis' encyclical calls us to care for our "common home." Moving to renewable energy is part of our moral responsibility to protect creation and ensure future generations can thrive.

### Scripture Connection
> "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it."
> — Psalm 24:1

### Faith Theme
**Stewardship** — We are not owners of the Earth but caretakers. How we use energy affects our neighbors (near and far) and future generations. Renewable energy is part of living justly.

## 📝 Week 5 Procedure: Energy Basics & Laudato Si' (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Lord, You filled the Earth with energy — in the sun, wind, and water! Help us learn to use Your gifts wisely. May we be good stewards of Your creation. Amen."

### Energy Introduction (10 min)
**What is energy?**

**Definition:**

- Energy = Ability to do work

- Can't be created or destroyed, only transformed

- Measured in joules, watts, kilowatt-hours

**Energy sources:**

**Nonrenewable:**

- Coal, oil, natural gas

- Nuclear (uranium)

- Took millions of years to form

- Will run out eventually

- Often pollute

**Renewable:**

- Solar — from the sun

- Wind — from moving air

- Hydro — from moving water

- Geothermal — from Earth's heat

- Biomass — from plants/organic matter

- Replenish naturally

- Generally cleaner

### Laudato Si' Deep Dive (15 min)
**Pope Francis on Energy:**

**Read excerpts:**

> "Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods." (LS 25)

> "There is an urgent need to develop policies so that... CO2 emissions can be drastically reduced... substituting renewable energy sources for fossil fuels." (LS 26)

> "We must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor." (LS 49)

**Discussion:**

- Why does the Pope write about energy?

- How is energy a MORAL issue?

- Who suffers most from pollution?

- How can renewable energy help the poor?

**Key concepts:**

- **Integral ecology** — Everything is connected

- **Common good** — Energy decisions affect everyone

- **Intergenerational justice** — What about our grandchildren?

- **Preferential option for the poor** — Who bears the burden?

### Energy Audit (15 min)
**Assess your energy use:**

**Think about your day:**

- Lights you used

- Devices you charged

- Transportation

- Heating/cooling

- Hot water

**Calculate (estimates):**
| Activity | Energy Source | Renewable? |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Lights   |               |           |
| Computer |               |           |
| Car/bus  |               |           |
| Heat     |               |           |

**Reflection questions:**

- Where does your electricity come from?

- What percentage is renewable?

- What could you change?

### Closing (3 min)
**Challenge:**
"Research your local energy mix. What percentage comes from renewable sources?"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Lord, forgive us for times we've wasted Your gifts. Help us be better stewards. Give us wisdom to find sustainable solutions. May we care for creation AND for the poor who suffer from pollution. Amen."

## 📝 Week 6 Procedure: Solar & Wind Power (45 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"God of sun and wind, You provide energy all around us! Help us learn to capture it wisely. Amen."

### Solar Power (12 min)
**Harnessing the sun:**

**How solar panels work:**

- Photovoltaic cells

- Light hits silicon

- Electrons move → electricity!

- No moving parts, quiet, clean

**Factors affecting output:**

- Angle to sun

- Direct vs. indirect light

- Temperature (cooler is better!)

- Shade

**Demonstration:**

- Show solar panel

- Measure voltage in different conditions

- Connect to small motor or LED

**Data collection:**
| Condition | Voltage (V) |
|-----------|-------------|
| Direct sun |            |
| Shade     |            |
| Angled    |            |

### Wind Power (12 min)
**Capturing moving air:**

**How wind turbines work:**

- Wind pushes blades

- Blades spin

- Generator converts motion to electricity

- Bigger = more power

**Factors affecting output:**

- Wind speed

- Blade size and shape

- Height of turbine

**Build mini wind turbine:**

- Paper/cardboard blades

- Attach to motor

- Test with fan

- Measure output

**Data collection:**
| Blade Design | Output |
|--------------|--------|
| 3 blades     |        |
| 4 blades     |        |
| Wide blades  |        |
| Narrow blades|        |

### Hydro Power Introduction (5 min)
**Moving water:**

**Concept:**

- Water flows downhill

- Turns turbines

- Clean, reliable

- But requires rivers/dams

**Simple demo:**

- Water wheel concept

- Show water turning wheel

### Comparison Analysis (10 min)
**Compare renewable sources:**

**Chart completion:**
| Source | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Solar  |      |      |          |
