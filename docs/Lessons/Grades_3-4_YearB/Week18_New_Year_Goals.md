# Week 18: New Year Goals

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Purposeful Living** — God calls us to live with intention and purpose. Setting goals isn't just about achievement — it's about becoming who God created us to be. We discern His will and work toward it!

### Scripture Connection
> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
> — Jeremiah 29:11

### Saint Connection
**St. Ignatius of Loyola** — Founder of the Jesuits who created the Examen — a daily reflection practice. He taught that reviewing our day helps us see God's presence and make better choices. Reflection leads to growth!
