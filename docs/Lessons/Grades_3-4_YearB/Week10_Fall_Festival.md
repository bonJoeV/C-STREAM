# Week 10: Fall Festival Engineering

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Harvest Thanksgiving** — Throughout history, people have celebrated harvest as a time to thank God for His provision. The Church's blessing of crops and harvest festivals remind us that all good things come from God.

### Scripture Connection
> "You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance."
> — Psalm 65:11

### Saint Connection
**St. Isidore the Farmer** — Patron saint of farmers and agriculture. He showed that humble work on the land is holy work. While he plowed, angels reportedly helped him, showing God's blessing on faithful labor.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- Pumpkins (mini or small)

- Fall items (leaves, acorns, corn)

- Building materials (cardboard, tape, straws)

- Challenge stations supplies

- Timers

- Award certificates

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"St. Isidore, patron of farmers, pray for us! Thank You, God, for the harvest that feeds us. Thank You for farmers who work the land. Help us be grateful for Your bounty! Amen."

### Harvest & Gratitude (5 min)
**Fall blessings:**

**Discussion:**

- What are you grateful for this fall?

- Where does our food come from?

- How is farming both science AND faith?

**St. Isidore's story:**

- Poor farmer in Spain

- Prayed while he worked

- Fed the hungry from his own food

- Showed that work is worship

**Agricultural science:**

- Seeds → Plants → Harvest

- Requires: soil, water, sun, care

- God's design in nature!

### Engineering Challenges (30 min)
**Fall Festival Engineering Stations:**

Divide class into groups, rotate through stations (8-10 min each):

---

**Station 1: Pumpkin Protector**
**Challenge:** Design packaging to protect a mini pumpkin from a 3-foot drop.

**Materials:** Cardboard, paper, tape, cotton balls, straws

**Rules:**

- Pumpkin must be retrievable

- Package must fit in a shoebox-sized space

- 8 minutes to design and build

**Test:** Drop and check for damage

**Engineering principles:** Cushioning, shock absorption, protection

---

**Station 2: Leaf Glider**
**Challenge:** Create a glider that carries a leaf the farthest distance.

**Materials:** Paper, straws, tape, actual leaves

**Rules:**

- Leaf must stay attached

- Must launch from standing position

- 3 flight attempts

**Test:** Measure distance traveled

**Engineering principles:** Lift, drag, balance (connects to earlier flight unit!)

---

**Station 3: Harvest Hauler**
**Challenge:** Build a device to transport "crops" (small items) across a distance.

**Materials:** Cardboard, straws, tape, string, wheels (optional)

**Rules:**

- Must move at least 3 items

- Must travel at least 2 feet

- Human power only (pushing, pulling, rolling)

**Test:** Successfully transport harvest

**Engineering principles:** Wheels, friction, load distribution

---

**Station 4: Corn Maze Mapper**
**Challenge:** Create a simple maze and program a partner to navigate it.

**Materials:** Paper for maze design, obstacle items

**Rules:**

- Draw a maze on paper

- Write "code" (directions) to navigate

- Partner follows code exactly

**Test:** Does the code work?

**Engineering principles:** Algorithms, precise instructions, debugging

---

### Celebration & Awards (3 min)
**Recognize achievements:**

- Best Pumpkin Protector

- Farthest Leaf Glider

- Most Efficient Hauler

- Best Maze Code

- Best Team Collaboration

**Share gratitude:**

- One thing thankful for from today

- One thing learned

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for fall harvest and fun challenges! Thank You for the engineers and farmers who help feed the world. Help us be grateful stewards of all You provide. St. Isidore, pray for us! Amen."

---

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We celebrated fall with engineering challenges! Ask your child about the challenges they completed and what they learned. Discuss: 'How do farmers use science?' 'What are you thankful for this harvest season?' 'Who was St. Isidore?' Consider visiting a farm or pumpkin patch together!"

---

## ✅ Assessment

- Participated actively in challenges

- Applied engineering problem-solving

- Demonstrated teamwork

- Expressed harvest gratitude
