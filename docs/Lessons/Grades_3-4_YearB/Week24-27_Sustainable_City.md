# Weeks 24-27: Sustainable City

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Laudato Si'** — Pope Francis calls us to care for our "common home." Sustainable cities represent our response to this call — designing human communities that live in harmony with God's creation.

### Scripture Connection
> "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."
> — Genesis 2:15

### Saint Connection
**St. Kateri Tekakwitha** — "Lily of the Mohawks," first Native American saint. She lived in harmony with nature and saw God in all creation. She reminds us of the sacred relationship between humans and Earth.
