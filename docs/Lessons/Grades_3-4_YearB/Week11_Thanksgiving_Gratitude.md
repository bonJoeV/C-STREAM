# Week 11: Thanksgiving Gratitude

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Gratitude as Prayer** — Thanksgiving is more than a holiday — it's a way of life! The Catechism teaches that every blessing calls for gratitude. When we count our blessings, we recognize God's goodness.

### Scripture Connection
> "Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:18

### Saint Connection
**St. Mary Faustina Kowalska** — Known for Divine Mercy, St. Faustina also practiced deep gratitude. She wrote in her diary about thanking God for everything — even difficulties. Gratitude transforms our hearts!
