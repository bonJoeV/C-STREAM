# Week 33: Easter Engineering

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**The Resurrection** — Easter is the most important celebration of the Christian year! Jesus rose from the dead, conquering death and bringing us hope of eternal life. All of nature echoes this theme in spring.

### Scripture Connection
> "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die."
> — John 11:25

### Saint Connection
**Mary Magdalene** — First witness to the Resurrection! She went to the tomb expecting death and found LIFE. She was the first to announce "He is risen!" — the greatest news ever.

**New life everywhere:**

- Spring bursting forth

- Flowers blooming from dead-looking bulbs

- Trees leafing from bare branches

- Baby animals being born

- "All of nature proclaims resurrection!"

**Discussion:**

- "How is spring like Easter?"

- "Where do you see new life?"

- "How does Easter give us hope?"

### Easter Engineering Challenges (27 min)
**Choose or rotate through challenges:**

---

**Challenge 1: Egg Drop Protection (10 min)**
**Design a container that protects an egg from a fall.**

**Materials:** Cardboard, cotton, tape, straws, fabric scraps

**Constraints:**

- Must fit in a paper bag

- No larger than 6 inches in any dimension

- Egg must be retrievable

**Connection:**
"The tomb couldn't contain Jesus! But our container protects new life."

**Test:** Drop from increasing heights.

---

**Challenge 2: Resurrection Garden (10 min)**
**Build a model Easter garden scene.**

**Materials:** Clay, small stones, sticks, moss, small plants

**Elements to include:**

- Empty tomb (cave with rolled stone)

- Garden setting

- Cross on hill (optional)

- Path to tomb

**Connection:**
"Create the scene Mary Magdalene saw that first Easter morning!"

---

**Challenge 3: Spring Launcher (10 min)**
**Build a device that launches a pompom "chick" into a nest.**

**Materials:** Popsicle sticks, rubber bands, spoon, tape, cup "nest"

**Design:**

- Create catapult or launcher

- Target: nest 3 feet away

- Points for accuracy

**Connection:**
"New life springs forth! Baby birds launch into the world!"

---

**Challenge 4: Butterfly Life Cycle Model (10 min)**
**Create a 3D model showing metamorphosis stages.**

**Materials:** Clay, paper, pipe cleaners, small containers

**Stages to show:**
1. Egg
2. Caterpillar
3. Chrysalis
4. Butterfly

**Connection:**
"The caterpillar 'dies' and becomes something COMPLETELY NEW — like resurrection!"

---

### Gallery & Sharing (3 min)
**Quick showcase:**

- Show what you built
