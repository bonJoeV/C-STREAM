# Week 28: Pi Day Activities

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Sacred Geometry** — The mathematical patterns in creation point to an intelligent Creator. Pi appears everywhere in nature — in orbits, waves, spirals. This constant ratio reveals God's orderly design of the universe.

### Scripture Connection
> "You have arranged all things by measure and number and weight."
> — Wisdom 11:20

### Saint Connection
**Nicholas of Cusa** — 15th century Catholic cardinal and mathematician who explored the relationship between the finite and infinite. He saw mathematics as a pathway to understanding God's infinite nature.

## 📚 Materials Needed

- Circular objects (various sizes)

- String or measuring tape

- Calculators

- Rulers

- Circular art supplies

- Pi digit printouts

- Compass tools

---

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"God of order and beauty, You created a universe of patterns and numbers! Help us see Your wisdom in mathematics today. As we explore Pi, may we marvel at Your infinite creativity. Amen."

### What is Pi? (8 min)
**Introduction to π:**

**The mystery:**

- "There's a special number hidden in EVERY circle!"

- "No matter how big or small the circle..."

- "The relationship between distance around and distance across is ALWAYS the same!"

**Definition:**

- **Circumference** = Distance around the circle

- **Diameter** = Distance across through center

- **Pi (π)** = Circumference ÷ Diameter

- **π ≈ 3.14159...**

**The amazing thing:**

- Pi NEVER ends!

- Pi NEVER repeats!

- Pi is IRRATIONAL (can't be written as simple fraction)

- We've calculated TRILLIONS of digits!

**Why March 14?**

- 3/14 (American date format)

- 3.14 = first digits of Pi!

- Pi Day celebrated since 1988

### Circle Measurement Lab (12 min)
**Discover Pi yourself!**

**Materials per group:**

- 3-4 circular objects

- String

- Ruler

- Calculator

- Data sheet

**Procedure:**
1. Measure circumference (wrap string, then measure string)
2. Measure diameter (straight across through center)
3. Divide: Circumference ÷ Diameter
4. Record answer
5. Repeat with different circles

**Data table:**
| Object | Circumference | Diameter | C ÷ D |
|--------|--------------|----------|-------|
| Cup    |              |          |       |
| Plate  |              |          |       |
| Lid    |              |          |       |

**Discovery questions:**

- "What do you notice about your answers?"

- "Are they all close to the same number?"

- "What number is it close to?"

**WOW moment:**
"You just discovered what mathematicians have known for 4,000 years! Every circle has the same ratio!"

### Pi Art (12 min)
**Create mathematical art:**

**Option A: Pi Skyline**

- Use Pi digits (3.1415926535...)

- Each digit = building height

- 3 squares, 1 square, 4 squares, etc.

- Create a city skyline from Pi!

**Option B: Pi Beads/Chain**

- Assign colors to digits 0-9

- String beads in Pi digit order

- Create bracelet or chain

**Option C: Pi-ku Poetry**

- Like haiku, but syllables match Pi

- Line 1: 3 syllables

- Line 2: 1 syllable

- Line 3: 4 syllables

- Line 4: 1 syllable

- Line 5: 5 syllables

**Option D: Circular Mandala**

- Use compass to draw circles

- Create geometric patterns

- Color with mathematical precision

### Faith Connection (4 min)
**God's infinite design:**

**Discussion:**

- "Pi is infinite — it never ends, never repeats"

- "Where else is infinity in math?"

- "How might God's infinity be like mathematical infinity?"

**Nicholas of Cusa's insight:**

- He saw math as a way to understand God

- Finite things (circles) reveal infinite truth (Pi)

- Math points to something BEYOND math!

**Sacred geometry:**

- Rose windows in cathedrals use mathematical patterns

- Ancient builders used Pi and Phi (golden ratio)

- Beauty and mathematics connect!

**Wonder:**
"Isn't it amazing that a number discovered by humans appears EVERYWHERE in nature that God created? Galaxies spiral with Pi. Sound waves involve Pi. The cycle of seasons follows circular patterns!"

### Closing (2 min)
**Pi facts to take home:**

- π ≈ 3.14159265358979...

- Pi appears in circles, spheres, waves, DNA spirals

- Pi Day is also Einstein's birthday!

**Challenge:**

- Memorize first 10 digits of Pi

- Look for circles in nature this week

**Closing Prayer:**
"Infinite God, Your creation is full of mathematical wonder! Thank You for Pi — a number that reveals Your endless creativity. Help us see Your design in numbers, patterns, and circles all around us. You are infinite, and Your love for us never ends — just like Pi! Amen."

## 📎 Home Connection
> "We celebrated Pi Day today! Ask your child: 'What is Pi?' 'How did you discover it?' 'What Pi art did you create?' Challenge: Measure circles at home together. Bonus: Make a circular pie and discuss the math of its shape!"

---

## ✅ Assessment

- Demonstrated understanding of Pi concept

- Accurately measured circles

- Created Pi-themed art

- Made connection to God's design
