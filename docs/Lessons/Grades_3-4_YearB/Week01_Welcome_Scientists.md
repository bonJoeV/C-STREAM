# Week 1: Welcome Back Scientists

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Faith and Reason** — As Catholics, we believe faith and science work together. Science helps us understand HOW God's creation works, while faith helps us understand WHY God created it. Great Catholic scientists throughout history have made incredible discoveries!

### Scripture Connection
> "Great are the works of the LORD, studied by all who delight in them."
> — Psalm 111:2

### Saint Connection
**St. Albert the Great** — Teacher of St. Thomas Aquinas, Albert was a scientist who studied nature, chemistry, biology, and geography. He believed studying creation brought us closer to the Creator. He's the patron saint of scientists!

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"St. Albert the Great, patron of scientists, pray for us! Lord, give us curious minds that seek to understand Your creation. Help us learn with honesty and wonder. Bless our Year B STREAM adventures! Amen."

### Year B Preview (8 min)
**What's coming this year:**

**Show preview images for each unit:**

- ✈️ **Flight & Aviation** — "We'll learn how planes fly!"

- 🏛️ **Architecture** — "We'll design buildings like cathedral architects!"

- 🌊 **Marine Science** — "We'll explore ocean ecosystems!"

- 🎮 **Game Design** — "We'll create our own games in Scratch!"

- 🌆 **Sustainable Cities** — "We'll design cities that care for creation!"

- 🌤️ **Weather Science** — "We'll become meteorologists!"

**Discussion:**

- What are you most excited about?

- What questions do you already have?

- What do you wonder about these topics?

### Scientific Method Review (10 min)
**The process scientists use:**

1. **Observe** — Use your senses carefully
2. **Question** — Ask "Why?" and "How?"
3. **Hypothesize** — Make an educated guess
4. **Experiment** — Test your hypothesis
5. **Analyze** — Look at your results
6. **Conclude** — What did you learn?
7. **Share** — Tell others!

**Quick practice:**

- Present mystery object

- Students observe silently (1 min)

- Share observations (descriptive, not guesses!)

- Form questions

- "How is observation different from guessing?"

**St. Albert connection:**

- "St. Albert carefully observed nature"

- "He wrote detailed notes about plants, animals, minerals"

- "He asked questions and tested ideas"

- "His faith inspired his curiosity!"
