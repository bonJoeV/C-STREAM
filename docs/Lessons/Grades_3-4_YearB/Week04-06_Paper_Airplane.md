# Weeks 4-6: Paper Airplane Challenge

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Made in God's Image** — When we design and create, we reflect God the Creator. Our creativity is a gift! The engineering design process — designing, testing, improving — mirrors how we grow in virtue.

### Scripture Connection
> "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."
> — Colossians 3:23

### Saint Connection
**Wright Brothers** — Though not saints, Orville and Wilbur Wright were raised by their minister father with strong faith. Their persistence through thousands of failures before achieving powered flight at Kitty Hawk shows how faith-inspired perseverance leads to success.

---

## 📝 Week 4 Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Creator God, You designed the universe with wisdom and love! Help us be creative designers too. Give us patience when things don't work and joy when they do. Amen."

### Challenge Introduction (5 min)
**Announce the Paper Airplane Challenge:**

**Categories:**
1. **Distance Champion** — Who can design a plane that flies the farthest?
2. **Hang Time Hero** — Who can keep their plane in the air longest?
3. **Accuracy Ace** — Who can hit the target most precisely?
4. **Stunt Star** — Who can design the coolest tricks?

**Rules:**

- Paper only (no other materials except allowed tape)

- Must be throwable by student

- Maximum of 3 sheets of paper

- Must be safe (no sharp points)

**Teams choose category:**

- Groups of 2-3

- Select focus category

- All teams will compete in all categories at finals

### Engineering Design Process Review (5 min)
**Steps to follow:**

1. **ASK** — What's the problem? What are constraints?
2. **IMAGINE** — Brainstorm solutions
3. **PLAN** — Choose best idea, make blueprint
4. **CREATE** — Build prototype
5. **TEST** — Does it work?
6. **IMPROVE** — Make it better based on tests
7. **SHARE** — Present your solution

"Engineers don't get it right the first time. They iterate — try, learn, improve!"

### Research Phase (12 min)
**Learn from existing designs:**

**Provide resources:**

- Paper airplane design books/printouts

- Videos of championship planes

- Basic fold patterns

**Teams research:**

- What designs work for their category?

- What makes planes fly far? Stay up? Go straight?

- Take notes in journals

**Key discoveries to guide toward:**

- **Distance:** Narrow, dart-like, heavy nose

- **Hang Time:** Wide wings, light, glider-style

- **Accuracy:** Balanced, straight creases, fins

- **Acrobatics:** Special folds, adjustable surfaces

### Initial Design (14 min)
**Design worksheet:**

- Category chosen

- Sketch of design (3 views)

- Materials list

- Hypothesis: "We think this will work because..."

**Build first prototype:**

- Follow your plan

- Make careful folds

- Label your plane

### Closing (2 min)
**Checkpoint:**

- "What did your team design?"

- "Why do you think it will work?"

**Preview:**
"Next week: Testing and improving! Your first design probably won't be perfect — that's GOOD! We learn from failure!"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for the gift of creativity. Help us learn from our mistakes and keep improving. Bless our teamwork. Amen."

## 📝 Week 5 Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Lord, the Wright Brothers failed thousands of times before success. Help us have that same perseverance! Amen."

### Testing Round 1 (12 min)
**Test your design:**

**All categories measured:**

- Distance (measuring tape)

- Hang time (stopwatch)

- Accuracy (distance from target)

- Stability (straight flight?)

**Each team:**

- 3 test flights

- Record all data

- Calculate average

**Data table in journals:**
| Test | Distance | Hang Time | Accuracy | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1    |          |           |          |       |
| 2    |          |           |          |       |
| 3    |          |           |          |       |
| Avg  |          |           |          |       |

### Analysis & Redesign (10 min)
**Study your results:**

- What worked well?

- What didn't work?

- What could you change?

**Connect to four forces:**

- Not enough lift? → Wider wings

- Too much drag? → Sleeker design

- Not stable? → Add fins or adjust balance

- Not enough thrust? → Optimize for throwing

**Improvement plan:**

- List 2-3 changes to try

- Explain WHY each change might help

- Sketch modified design

### Build Version 2.0 (10 min)
**Create improved prototype:**

- Apply your changes

- Keep careful folds

- Label as "Version 2"

**Test immediately:**

- Same 3 trials

- Record data

- Compare to Version 1

### Analysis Discussion (4 min)
**Share findings:**

- "Who improved their results?"

- "What changes made the biggest difference?"

- "Anyone surprised by their results?"

**Faith connection:**

- "How is this like growing in virtue?"

- "We try, fail, learn, try again"

- "Perseverance is a spiritual gift!"

### Closing (2 min)
**Status check:**

- Version 2 results

- Plans for final version

**Preview:**
"Next week: Final designs and competition!"

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for teaching us through testing and trying. Help us be patient learners who never give up. Amen."
