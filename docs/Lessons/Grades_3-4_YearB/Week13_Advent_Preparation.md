# Week 13: Advent Preparation

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**Christ the Light** — Advent prepares us for Christmas when Jesus, the Light of the World, came to shine in our darkness. Just as we study how physical light works, we remember that Jesus is the TRUE light that illuminates our lives.

### Scripture Connection
> "The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned."
> — Isaiah 9:2

### Saint Connection
**Jesse Tree Symbols** — The Jesse Tree shows Jesus' family history through symbols. Each symbol represents someone who prepared the way for Christ — from Jesse (King David's father) all the way to Mary. It's a visual way to see God's plan!

## 📚 Materials Needed

- Flashlights, mirrors, prisms (light exploration)

- LED tea lights (safe!)

- Tissue paper, colored cellophane

- Cardboard tubes, jars

- Jesse Tree symbol templates

- Craft supplies

## 📝 Lesson Procedure (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Lord Jesus, You are the Light of the World! As we prepare for Christmas, help us see Your light shining in the darkness. May we become lights for others. Amen."

### Light Science Exploration (10 min)
**How does light work?**

**Key concepts:**

- Light travels in straight lines

- Light can be reflected (bounced)

- Light can be transmitted (passed through)

- Light can be absorbed (stopped)

- Light can be refracted (bent)

**Quick demonstrations:**
1. **Straight lines:** Flashlight through holes in cards — only works if aligned
2. **Reflection:** Mirror bouncing light
3. **Transmission:** Light through clear vs. colored cellophane
4. **Absorption:** Light on dark vs. light surfaces

**Discussion:**

- "Why do we use candles in Advent?"

- "What does light represent?"

- "How does light 'break' darkness?"

### Advent & Jesse Tree (8 min)
**Advent preparation:**

**What is Advent?**

- 4 weeks of preparation

- Waiting and hoping

- Getting ready for Jesus

- Lighting candles (1-2-3-4)

**Jesse Tree explained:**

- Shows Jesus' family history

- Each symbol = someone who pointed to Jesus

- Based on Isaiah 11:1 — "A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse"

**Key symbols:**

- 🌍 **Creation** — God made everything

- 🌈 **Rainbow** — Noah, God's promise

- ⭐ **Star** — Abraham, countless descendants
