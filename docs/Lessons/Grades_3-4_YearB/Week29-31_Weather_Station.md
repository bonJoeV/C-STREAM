# Weeks 29-31: Weather Station

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**God's Providence in Nature** — Weather patterns show God's continuous care for creation. Rain waters crops, sun provides warmth, winds distribute seeds. Even challenging weather reminds us of our dependence on God.

### Scripture Connection
> "He sends his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly. He spreads the snow like wool and scatters the frost like ashes."
> — Psalm 147:15-16

### Saint Connection
**St. Medard of Noyon** — Patron saint of weather, farmers, and vintners. According to legend, he was protected from rain by an eagle as a child. He reminds us that weather has always fascinated people of faith!

**Discussion:**

- "How does weather show God's care?"

- "Why might we pray about weather?"

- "Who needs our prayers when weather is severe?"

### Closing (2 min)
**Weather journal assignment:**

- Record weather daily this week

- Note: temperature, sky, wind, precipitation

- Look for patterns

**Closing Prayer:**
"Thank You, God, for all kinds of weather! Help us understand Your creation better. Be with all people facing storms today. Amen."

---

## 📝 Week 30 Procedure: Building Weather Tools (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"Creator God, help us build tools to understand Your world better! Bless our work today. Amen."

### Weather Data Review (3 min)
**Check journals:**

- What weather did you observe this week?

- Any patterns?

- Any surprises?

### Build Weather Instruments (32 min)
**Rotate through stations or build sequentially:**

---

**Station 1: Rain Gauge (8 min)**

**Materials:**

- Clear plastic bottle (cut top off)

- Ruler

- Permanent marker

- Tape

**Build:**
1. Cut top third off bottle
2. Invert top into bottom (funnel)
3. Tape ruler to outside
4. Mark measurements in inches

**Use:**

- Place outside in open area

- Check and record daily

- Empty after recording

---

**Station 2: Wind Vane (8 min)**

**Materials:**

- Straw

- Paper (for arrow)

- Pin

- Pencil with eraser

- Small cup/base

**Build:**
1. Cut arrow point and tail from paper
2. Attach to straw ends
3. Find balance point, push pin through
4. Pin into eraser of pencil in base

**Use:**

- Arrow points INTO wind

- Cardinal directions labeled

---

**Station 3: Anemometer (8 min)**

**Materials:**

- 4 small cups

- 2 straws

- Pin

- Pencil with eraser

**Build:**
1. Cross straws, pin together through center
2. Attach cups to straw ends (all facing same rotational direction)
3. Mark one cup with color
4. Pin through eraser

**Use:**

- Count rotations per minute

- More rotations = faster wind

---

**Station 4: Barometer (8 min)**

## 📝 Week 31 Procedure: Data & Predictions (40 minutes)

### Opening Prayer (2 min)
"God who knows all things, help us learn to read the signs of weather You've placed in nature! Amen."

### Collect Data (10 min)
**Check instruments:**

If instruments were placed outside:

- Read rain gauge (record, empty)

- Note wind vane direction

- Count anemometer rotations

- Check barometer position

**Compare with official data:**

### Weather Prediction (10 min)
**How meteorologists predict:**

**Clues they use:**

- Air pressure (falling = storm coming)

- Wind direction (changes signal fronts)

- Cloud types (certain clouds mean rain)

- Temperature trends

- Humidity levels

**Make your prediction:**
Using your data and current observations:

- Tomorrow's forecast

- This week's forecast

- Explain your reasoning

**Weather rhymes:**

- "Red sky at night, sailor's delight; red sky in morning, sailor's warning"
