# Week 12: Gifts for Others

## 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration

### Catholic Teaching Connection
**The Gift of Self** — Jesus gave us the ultimate gift — Himself! When we create gifts for others, we share our time, talent, and love. The best gifts come from the heart and serve others' needs.

### Scripture Connection
> "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace."
> — 1 Peter 4:10

### Saint Connection
**St. Elizabeth Ann Seton** — First American-born saint! She founded schools and served the poor. She used her gifts of teaching and organizing to help thousands. She showed that our talents are meant to be shared.
