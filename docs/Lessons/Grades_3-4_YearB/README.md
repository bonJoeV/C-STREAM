# Grades 3-4 Year B Lessons (Ages 8-10)

## Year Overview

This is the **Year B curriculum** for Grades 3-4, designed to be used in alternating years with [Year A](../Grades_3-4_YearA/README.md). Year B covers the same STREAM skills and standards but through **different contexts, projects, and saints**. This ensures students in combined 3-4 classrooms don't repeat the same content in consecutive years.

### Year B Themes

- **Architecture & Design** (vs Year A's bridge engineering)

- **Marine Science** (vs Year A's environmental science)

- **Game Design** (vs Year A's animation)

- **Sustainable Cities** (vs Year A's machine engineering)

### Class Details

- **Duration:** 40 minutes per session

- **Sessions:** 34 weeks (follows school calendar)

- **Technology:** Scratch coding, KEVA planks, basic robotics
