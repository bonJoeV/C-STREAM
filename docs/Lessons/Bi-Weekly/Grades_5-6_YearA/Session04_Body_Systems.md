# Session 4: Human Body Systems

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Identify major body systems and their functions

- Understand how systems interconnect

- Model a body system

- Appreciate the design of the human body

---

# Session 4: Human Body Systems

## Materials Needed

- 📸 Body system diagrams

- 📦 Model-building materials

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 💻 Digital resources (optional)

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Psalm 139** — "I am fearfully and wonderfully made!" God designed our bodies with incredible wisdom.

### Scripture
> *"For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made."* — Psalm 139:13-14

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for the incredible gift of our bodies. Help us appreciate your amazing design and care for these temples of the Holy Spirit. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (8 minutes)
1. **Amazing Design:**
   - "Your body is more complex than any machine!"
   - 37 trillion cells working together
   - Multiple systems coordinating constantly
2. **Major Body Systems:**
   - 🫀 **Circulatory** — Heart, blood vessels, blood
   - 🫁 **Respiratory** — Lungs, airways, breathing
   - 🦴 **Skeletal** — Bones, joints, structure
   - 💪 **Muscular** — Muscles, movement
   - 🧠 **Nervous** — Brain, nerves, senses
   - 🍽️ **Digestive** — Stomach, intestines, processing food
3. **Systems Work Together:**
   - You can't breathe without muscles
   - Heart needs nerves to beat
   - Everything is integrated!
4. **Fearfully & Wonderfully Made:**
   - God's design is incredible
   - Dignity of human life

### Main Activity: Body System Exploration (28 minutes)

**Part 1: System Investigation (10 minutes)**

**Choose ONE system to investigate in depth:**

- Circulatory System

- Respiratory System

- Nervous System

- Digestive System

**Research Questions:**

- What are the main parts?

- What does this system do?

- How does it connect to other systems?

- What happens if it fails?

**Part 2: Model Creation (14 minutes)**

**Create a model of your system:**

**Circulatory Model:**

- Show heart chambers

- Show blood flow (red = oxygen, blue = CO2)

- Show major vessels

**Respiratory Model:**

- Show lungs and airways

- Demonstrate air flow

- Connect to circulatory

**Nervous System Model:**

- Show brain and spinal cord

- Show nerve pathways

- Demonstrate signal transmission

**Digestive Model:**

- Show digestive tract

- Show processing stages

- Demonstrate nutrient absorption

**Part 3: System Connections (4 minutes)**

- Share models

- Discuss: How does YOUR system connect to others?

- "None can work alone!"

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your body system model (label parts)
2. Write: "This system's job is..."
3. Write: "It connects to other systems by..."
4. Write: "Our bodies show God's design because..."

### Closing Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Wonder & Gratitude** — "What amazes you about your body?"
2. **Stewardship** — "How should we care for this gift?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for the miracle of our bodies. Help us care for these temples of your Holy Spirit. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified system components

- [ ] Explained system function

- [ ] Created accurate model

- [ ] Connected to other systems

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on one simple system

- Template for model

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Research diseases/disorders

- Create multi-system connection diagram

- Investigate medical engineering

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Feel your pulse and count heartbeats! Time your breathing. Research one body system in depth. Discuss: How does knowing we're "fearfully made" affect how we treat our bodies?

---

## Teacher Notes

- Emphasize human dignity

- Connect to health education

- Consider visit from medical professional

- Body models can be displayed
