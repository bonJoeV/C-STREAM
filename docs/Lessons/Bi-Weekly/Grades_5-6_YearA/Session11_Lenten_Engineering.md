## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Corporal and Spiritual Works of Mercy** — Traditional Catholic ways to serve: Feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, visit the sick, comfort the sorrowful, counsel the doubtful...

### Scripture
> *"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."* — Matthew 25:40

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, during Lent we prepare for Easter by growing closer to you through service. Help us use our skills to serve "the least of these." Guide our designs and our hearts. Amen.*
