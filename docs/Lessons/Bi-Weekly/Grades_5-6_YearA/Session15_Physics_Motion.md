# Session 15: Physics & Motion ⚡

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 15 of 17

Students explore Newton's Laws of Motion through hands-on experiments and engineering applications.

---

# Session 15: Physics & Motion

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand Newton's three laws of motion

- Conduct motion experiments

- Apply physics to engineering design

- See order and consistency in God's creation

---

# Session 15: Physics & Motion

## Materials Needed

- 🚗 Motion experiment materials (cars, balls, ramps)

- 📏 Measurement tools

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📸 Newton's Laws visuals

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Natural Law** — The consistent laws of physics reflect God's orderly creation. Newton himself saw his discoveries as revealing God's design!

### Scripture
> *"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."* — Psalm 19:1

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created a universe of order and consistency. Help us discover the laws you built into creation. May our understanding deepen our awe of your wisdom. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (8 minutes)
1. **Physics = God's Order:**
   - Universe follows consistent laws
   - We can discover and use them!
   - Isaac Newton: "This most beautiful system could only proceed from the dominion of an intelligent Being."
2. **Newton's Three Laws:**
   - **1st Law (Inertia):** Objects stay at rest or in motion unless acted upon by a force
   - **2nd Law (F=ma):** Force = Mass × Acceleration
   - **3rd Law (Action-Reaction):** Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
3. **Why It Matters:**
   - Every machine, vehicle, building uses these laws!
   - Engineers apply physics constantly

### Main Activity: Motion Experiments (28 minutes)

**Part 1: First Law - Inertia (8 minutes)**

**Experiment: Tablecloth Pull**

- Objects want to stay where they are!

- Demo: Pull cloth from under objects

- Or: Coin/card on cup (flick card, coin drops)

**Application:**

- Seatbelts (body wants to keep moving in crash)

- Why you lean when car turns

**Engineering Connection:**

- Safety systems must account for inertia

**Part 2: Second Law - F=ma (8 minutes)**

**Experiment: Ramp Races**

- Same ball, different ramps (angles)

- More force (gravity) = more acceleration

- Different masses, same ramp

**Observations:**

- Steeper = faster acceleration

- Heavier objects need more force to accelerate same

**Engineering Connection:**

- Car engines, rockets, sports equipment

**Part 3: Third Law - Action-Reaction (8 minutes)**

**Experiment: Balloon Rocket**

- Inflate balloon on string track

- Release: Air goes back, balloon goes forward!

- Equal and opposite!

**Other Examples:**

- Walking (push ground back, move forward)

- Swimming (push water back, move forward)

- Rockets (push exhaust down, rocket goes up)

**Engineering Connection:**

- Jet engines, rockets, propellers

**Part 4: Design Application (4 minutes)**

- Quick sketch: Design something that uses all 3 laws

- Examples: Car, rocket, sports equipment

- Label which law applies where

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Write each law in your own words
2. Draw one experiment and explain results
3. Your design sketch with laws labeled
4. Write: "Physics shows God's order because..."

### Closing Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Laws Appreciation** — "Which law surprised you most?"
2. **Order in Creation** — "How does physics reveal God's design?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for the consistent laws that govern your creation. Help us use this knowledge to engineer solutions that serve others. Amen."*

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on demonstrations

- Simple law explanations

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Calculate force/acceleration

- Design complex application

- Research advanced physics

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Find Newton's laws at home! Watch videos of rockets, sports, car crashes (safety videos). Discuss: How do these laws affect everyday life? Research Newton's faith!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Simple materials work best

- Safety with balloon rockets

- Connect to playground physics

- Great for outdoor experiments
