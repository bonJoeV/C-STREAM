## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Paul** — "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race." Excellence in effort honors God!

### Scripture
> *"Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize."* — 1 Corinthians 9:24

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, help us give our best effort today. May our work honor you whether we win or struggle. Teach us to celebrate others' success and learn from our challenges. Amen.*
