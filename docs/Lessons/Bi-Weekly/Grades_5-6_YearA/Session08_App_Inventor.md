## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — Created websites and digital content to share faith. He'd have loved making apps!

### Scripture
> *"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations."* — Matthew 28:19 (Apps can share the Gospel!)

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for technology that connects people. Help us create apps that serve others and share your love. Guide our programming today! Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Mobile Apps:**
   - "You use apps every day—now you'll CREATE one!"
   - Apps solve problems and serve users
   - Billions of people use apps
2. **MIT App Inventor:**
   - Free, browser-based tool
   - Makes real Android apps!
   - Created at MIT for learning
3. **Blessed Carlo Acutis:**
   - Used digital skills for faith
   - "The internet is a gift from God"
   - Apps can spread love!

### Main Activity: First App Creation (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Interface Tour (8 minutes)**

**Two Main Screens:**
1. **Designer** — How app looks
   - Components palette
   - Screen layout
   - Properties

2. **Blocks** — How app works
   - Event blocks (when button clicked)
   - Action blocks (what happens)
   - Logic blocks

**Demo:** Create new project, add button, test

**Part 2: Build Your First App (18 minutes)**

**Guided Project: Personal Message App**

**In Designer (7 min):**
1. Add Label (title)
2. Add TextBox (user input)
3. Add Button (submit)
4. Add Label (output display)
5. Customize colors and text

**In Blocks (8 min):**

   - Set OutputLabel.Text to TextBox.Text
2. Add more functionality:
   - Text to Speech (say the message!)
   - Clear button

**Testing (3 min):**

- Use AI Companion app or emulator

- Test your app!

- Debug any issues

**Part 3: Customization (4 minutes)**

- Make it your own:
  - Change colors
  - Add image
  - Additional features

- Ideas: Prayer app, gratitude journal, quiz

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Sketch your app screens
2. List components used
3. Write: "My app does..."
4. Write: "I could create an app that helps others by..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **App Ideas** — "What app would you create to help people?"
2. **Tech for Good** — "How can apps serve God's kingdom?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for the ability to create. Help us use technology to serve you and others. Amen."*
