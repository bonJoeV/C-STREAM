## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Pope Francis & Laudato Si'** — "Care for our common home" calls us to protect God's creation!

### Scripture
> *"The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."* — Genesis 2:15

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created our beautiful world and gave us responsibility to care for it. Help us be good stewards of creation. Guide our designs to protect your earth. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (8 minutes)
1. **Creation Care:**
   - God gave us Earth to steward
   - "Laudato Si'" — Pope Francis's encyclical on environment
   - Catholics have responsibility to care for creation
2. **Environmental Challenges:**
   - Climate change
   - Pollution (air, water, plastic)
   - Resource depletion
   - Habitat destruction
   - Waste management
3. **Engineering Solutions:**
   - Technology can help solve these problems!
   - Sustainable design principles
   - "Leave it better than we found it"

### Main Activity: Sustainability Design (28 minutes)

**Part 1: Problem Investigation (8 minutes)**

**Choose an Environmental Focus:**

- Plastic waste reduction

- Energy conservation

- Water protection

- Air quality improvement

- Food waste reduction

- Habitat protection

**Research:**

- How big is this problem?

- What's causing it?

- What solutions exist?

- What's still needed?

**Part 2: Design a Solution (15 minutes)**

**Apply Design Thinking:**

1. **Define the Problem (3 min):**
   - Specific, local focus
   - "How might we reduce _____ in our school/community?"

2. **Ideate Solutions (4 min):**
   - Many ideas quickly
   - Technology-enhanced options
   - Behavior change options
   - System redesign options

3. **Design & Prototype (8 min):**
   - Choose best idea
   - Create detailed design:
     - How does it work?
     - What's needed to implement?
     - What impact will it have?
   - Calculate potential impact if possible

**Part 3: Solution Share (5 minutes)**

- Present designs

- Discuss feasibility

- Identify school implementation opportunities

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Problem you addressed: ___
2. Your solution design (sketch and explain)
3. Potential impact: ___
4. Write: "Catholics should care for creation because..."

### Closing Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Action Items** — "What can we actually DO?"
2. **Laudato Si' Connection** — "How does Pope Francis challenge us?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Creator God, thank you for our beautiful planet. Help us be faithful stewards who protect and restore your creation. Amen."*
