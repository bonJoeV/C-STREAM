## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Hildegard of Bingen** — A true polymath: composer, writer, philosopher, scientist, and mystic. She integrated multiple disciplines in service of God!

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."* — Colossians 3:23

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you designed the universe with infinite wisdom. Help us become thoughtful designers who use our skills to serve others. May our work honor you. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (8 minutes)
1. **Design Thinking Review:**
   - "You've done design thinking before—now we go deeper!"
   - The five stages (Stanford d.school model):
     - 💗 EMPATHIZE — Understand users deeply
     - 🎯 DEFINE — Frame the right problem
     - 💡 IDEATE — Generate many solutions
     - 🔧 PROTOTYPE — Build to think
     - 🧪 TEST — Learn and iterate
2. **St. Hildegard:**
   - Medieval genius who integrated faith and learning
   - Scientist, musician, writer, healer
   - "Faith doesn't limit learning—it expands it!"
3. **Human-Centered Design:**
   - Design FOR people, not just problems
   - Empathy is the foundation

### Main Activity: Design Challenge Sprint (28 minutes)

**Part 1: Empathy Deep Dive (8 minutes)**

**Challenge:** Design something to help a specific person at school

**Interview Process:**

- Partner with classmate or imagine a specific person

- Ask deeper questions:
  - Walk me through your typical day
  - What frustrates you most?
  - When do you feel overwhelmed?
  - What do you wish existed?

- Listen for emotions, not just facts

- Note unspoken needs

**Part 2: Define the Problem (5 minutes)**

- Write a "How Might We" statement:
  - "How might we help [user] with [problem] so that [outcome]?"

- Example: "How might we help younger students feel welcome so that they enjoy coming to school?"

- This reframes problems as opportunities!

**Part 3: Rapid Ideation (5 minutes)**

- 10 ideas in 5 minutes—GO!

- Quantity over quality

- Wild ideas welcome

- Build on others' ideas

- No judgment yet!

**Part 4: Prototype (8 minutes)**

- Choose most promising idea

- Build quick prototype:
  - Sketch, model, or storyboard
  - Just enough to show the concept
  - "Fake it" if needed—it's about testing ideas!

- Prepare to explain and get feedback

**Part 5: Test & Iterate (2 minutes)**

- Share prototype with partner

- Get honest feedback

- Note: What works? What needs refinement?

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Write your "How Might We" statement
2. Sketch your top 3 ideas
3. Draw your prototype
4. Write: "Feedback I received..."
5. Write: "Human-centered design matters because..."

### Closing Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Design Principle Share** — "What's the most important design thinking insight?"
2. **Service Connection** — "How is design thinking Catholic?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, help us see others' needs and design solutions with love. May our creativity serve your kingdom. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Conducted empathetic inquiry

- [ ] Created clear problem statement

- [ ] Generated multiple ideas

- [ ] Built testable prototype

- [ ] Incorporated feedback

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Structured interview questions

- Partner work throughout

- Template for "How Might We"

### For Advanced Students

- Design for more complex challenge

- Multiple iteration cycles

- Create design documentation

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Use design thinking at home! Interview family members about a challenge. Create a "How Might We" statement. Brainstorm solutions together and test one!

---

## Teacher Notes

- This framework is used throughout the year

- Post design thinking stages permanently

- Encourage genuine empathy in interviews

- Prototypes should be rough—focus on learning
