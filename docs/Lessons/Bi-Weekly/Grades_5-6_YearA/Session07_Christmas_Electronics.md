# Session 7: Christmas Electronics 🎄

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 7 of 17

Students use Little Bits to create interactive Christmas/Advent electronic projects.

---

# Session 7: Christmas Electronics

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Apply electronic circuit concepts

- Design interactive electronic projects

- Use inputs, outputs, and logic in circuits

- Create meaningful Advent/Christmas creations

---

# Session 7: Christmas Electronics

## Materials Needed

- 💡 Little Bits kits (from CSCOE library)

- 📦 Craft materials for mounting

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🎄 Christmas/Advent theme supplies

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Lucy** — Her name means "light." She brought hope during dark times. Celebrated during Advent!

### Scripture
> *"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light."* — Isaiah 9:2

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, you are the Light of the World. As we prepare for Christmas, help us create projects that spread your light and love. Come, Lord Jesus! Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Advent & Light:**
   - Shortest days, longest nights
   - Light grows as Christmas approaches
   - Jesus = Light breaking into darkness
2. **St. Lucy:**
   - Name means "light"
   - Brought food to hiding Christians wearing candle crown
   - Celebrated December 13
3. **Little Bits Review:**
   - Blue = Power
   - Pink = Inputs (buttons, sensors)
   - Green = Outputs (lights, sounds, motors)
   - Orange = Wires
4. **Today:** Create interactive Advent/Christmas electronics!

### Main Activity: Christmas Electronics (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Circuit Planning (5 minutes)**

**Choose a Project:**

**Option A: Interactive Nativity**

- Light sensor triggers star light

- Sound activated Angel "Gloria!"

- Motion-triggered stable lights

**Option B: Advent Wreath**

- Buttons for each candle

- Progressive lighting (week 1, 2, 3, 4)

- Light sensor for "darkness to light"

**Option C: Christmas Card/Gift**

- Touch-activated music

- Light-up elements

- Personalized message display

**Option D: Light of the World Display**

- Darkness sensor activates light

- "Light in darkness" demonstration

- Interactive elements

**Part 2: Build & Test (20 minutes)**

**Circuit Building:**
1. Plan circuit on paper (2 min)
2. Gather Little Bits components (2 min)
3. Build circuit in stages:
   - Power first
   - Add input
   - Add output
   - Test each stage
4. Mount on project base (5 min)
5. Refine and debug (3 min)

**Part 3: Demonstration & Gallery (5 minutes)**

- Share creations

- Explain circuit and meaning

- Celebrate the light!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your circuit (label components)
2. Explain what each part does
3. Write: "Light is important at Advent because..."
4. Write: "My creation represents..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Light Celebration** — All circuits light up!
2. **Advent Hope** — "What does Jesus' light mean to you?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Jesus, Light of the World, shine in our hearts. Help us bring your light to everyone we meet. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Built working circuit

- [ ] Used inputs and outputs

- [ ] Created meaningful project

- [ ] Connected to faith theme

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Simpler single-input circuit

- Partner work

- Template circuit design

### For Advanced Students

- Multiple inputs/outputs

- Logic modules

- Interactive sequence

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Share your creation with family! Discuss light symbolism in Advent. Notice how light increases as Christmas approaches. Create more light-themed projects together!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve Little Bits from CSCOE

- Test all components before class

- Projects make great gifts

- Display at Christmas concert
