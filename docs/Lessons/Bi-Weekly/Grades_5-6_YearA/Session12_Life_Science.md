---

# Session 12: Life Science

## Materials Needed

- 🔬 Microscopes (if available)

- 📸 Cell/DNA diagrams

- 📦 Investigation materials

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 💻 Digital resources

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Easter Preparation** — Just as cells divide and organisms transform, Easter celebrates the ultimate transformation: death to new life!

### Scripture
> *"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die."* — John 11:25

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created life with incredible complexity and beauty. As we study your living creation, help us see your wisdom and prepare our hearts for Easter's celebration of new life. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Life's Complexity:**
   - Every living thing is incredibly complex
   - Trillions of cells in your body
   - DNA instructions in every cell
2. **Life Science Areas:**
   - Cells — Building blocks of life
   - DNA — Instructions for life
   - Ecology — Connections between life
3. **Resurrection Theme:**
   - Life constantly renews
   - Death leads to new life (seeds, metamorphosis)
   - Easter: Ultimate new life!

### Main Activity: Life Science Investigation (30 minutes)

**Choose ONE Investigation Track:**

**Track A: Cell Exploration (if microscopes available)**

1. **Prepare Slides (8 min):**
   - Onion skin cells
   - Cheek cells
   - Pond water organisms

2. **Observe & Draw (12 min):**
   - Find cells under microscope
   - Identify parts: membrane, nucleus
   - Sketch observations

3. **Analysis (5 min):**
   - Compare plant and animal cells
   - Discuss: Why are cells called "building blocks of life"?

4. **Connection (5 min):**
   - Cells constantly divide and renew
   - "New life" happening right now!

**Track B: DNA Discovery (no microscope)**

1. **DNA Background (8 min):**
   - DNA = Instructions for life
   - Double helix structure
   - Every cell has complete instructions

2. **DNA Extraction (12 min):**
   - Extract DNA from strawberry/banana
   - See real DNA!
   - Discuss: This contains instructions for making more fruit!

3. **DNA Model (5 min):**
   - Create simple DNA model
   - Show double helix, base pairs

4. **Connection (5 min):**
   - DNA passes from generation to generation
   - Life continues through inheritance

**Track C: Ecosystem Investigation**

1. **Local Ecosystem (8 min):**
   - Observe outdoor space or images
   - Identify producers, consumers, decomposers

2. **Web of Life Activity (12 min):**
   - Create detailed food web
   - Show energy flow
   - Identify keystone species

3. **Analysis (5 min):**
   - What happens if one species disappears?
   - How is life interconnected?

4. **Connection (5 min):**
   - Cycle of life: death feeds new life
   - Everything is connected

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your investigation observations
2. Key discovery: ___
3. Write: "Life shows God's design because..."
4. Write: "This connects to Easter because..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Wonder** — "What amazed you about life today?"
2. **Easter Preview** — "How does studying life prepare us for Easter?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God of life, thank you for the miracle of living things. As Easter approaches, help us celebrate your gift of new and eternal life. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Engaged in investigation

- [ ] Made accurate observations

- [ ] Connected to faith themes

- [ ] Demonstrated understanding

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Guided observation sheets

- Partner work

- Focus on key concepts

### For Advanced Students

- Independent research extension

- Complex analysis

- Connection to bioengineering

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Observe life around you! Look for signs of spring and new life. Research DNA or cells online. Discuss: How does understanding life increase our appreciation of the Creator?

---

## Teacher Notes

- Choose track based on available equipment

- DNA extraction works with household items

- Great timing before Easter

- Connect to science curriculum
