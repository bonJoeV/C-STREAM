## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**God the Creator** — We are made in the image of the Creator! Our creativity reflects His nature.

### Scripture
> *"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."* — Ephesians 2:10

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created us in your image as creative beings. Help us use all we've learned to invent something that serves others. May our work honor you. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Capstone Project:**
   - "Apply EVERYTHING you've learned!"
   - Design thinking + technology + engineering + faith
2. **Year Skills Review:**
   - Design thinking process
   - Programming (Scratch, Sphero, App Inventor)
   - Electronics (Little Bits, circuits)
   - Engineering (structures, physics)
   - Research and presentation
3. **Invention Requirements:**
   - Solve a real problem
   - Use skills from this year
   - Be original and creative
   - Be prepared to present

### Main Activity: Invention Lab (31 minutes)

**Part 1: Problem Identification (5 minutes)**

- What problem will you solve?

- Who will benefit?

- Why does this matter?

- Must be:
  - Real problem
  - Solvable with available skills/materials
  - Meaningful to someone

**Part 2: Design & Prototype (22 minutes)**

**Full Design Thinking Cycle:**

1. **EMPATHIZE (2 min):**
   - Who has this problem?
   - What's their experience?

2. **DEFINE (2 min):**
   - "How might we..." statement
   - Clear problem frame

3. **IDEATE (3 min):**
   - Multiple solution concepts
   - Choose best approach

4. **PROTOTYPE (12 min):**
   - Build working model
   - Options:
     - Physical construction
     - Programmed solution (Scratch/App)
     - Electronic circuit
     - Combination
   - Focus on demonstrating concept

5. **TEST (3 min):**
   - Does it work?
   - Get peer feedback
   - Note improvements needed

**Part 3: Presentation Prep (4 minutes)**

- Prepare 1-minute pitch:
  - Problem you solved
  - Your solution
  - How it works
  - Why it matters

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Invention name: ___
2. Problem solved: ___
3. Solution description:
4. Sketch/diagram:
5. Write: "I'm proud of this invention because..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Preview Showcase** — Quick share or preview for next session
2. **Creativity Celebration** — "You are inventors!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for the gift of creativity. Bless these inventions and the people they will help. Amen."*
