# Session 3: Structural Engineering 🏗️

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 3 of 17

Students explore structural engineering principles by designing and testing load-bearing structures.

---

# Session 3: Structural Engineering

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand key structural engineering concepts

- Identify forces: tension, compression, shear

- Build and test load-bearing structures

- Analyze structural failures

---

# Session 3: Structural Engineering

## Materials Needed

- 📦 KEVA Planks (from CSCOE library)

- 📦 Building materials (straws, toothpicks, marshmallows)

- 🪙 Weights for testing

- 📏 Measuring tools

- 📓 Engineering journals

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Medieval Cathedral Builders** — Anonymous craftsmen who built soaring cathedrals to glorify God. Their engineering still stands 800+ years later!

### Scripture
> *"Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain."* — Psalm 127:1

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, like the cathedral builders of old, help us build structures that honor you and serve others. Give us wisdom to create with integrity. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (8 minutes)
1. **Structural Engineering:**
   - "Making sure buildings don't fall down!"
   - Engineers calculate forces and design structures
2. **Key Forces:**
   - **Tension** — Pulling apart (rope in tug-of-war)
   - **Compression** — Pushing together (standing on box)
   - **Shear** — Sliding (deck of cards)
3. **Structural Elements:**
   - Triangles = Strong! (forces distributed)
   - Arch = Distributes compression
   - Column = Resists compression
   - Beam = Spans distances
4. **Cathedral Builders:**
   - Built structures that stood centuries
   - Flying buttresses, pointed arches
   - Glory to God through engineering

### Main Activity: Structural Challenge (28 minutes)

**Part 1: Force Demonstrations (5 minutes)**

- Tension: Stretch rubber band

- Compression: Push sponge

- Shear: Slide books

- Feel the forces!

- Where do these occur in buildings?

**Part 2: The Challenge (20 minutes)**

**Challenge:** Build a bridge or tower that holds maximum weight

**Bridge Challenge Option:**

- Span 12 inches (between two desks)

- Use provided materials

- Hold weight in the middle

- Goal: Maximum weight before failure

**Tower Challenge Option:**

- Build at least 12 inches tall

- Support weight on top

- Use provided materials

- Goal: Maximum weight before failure

**Engineering Process:**
1. **Design (4 min):**
   - Sketch with labels
   - Identify where forces will act
   - Plan triangulation

2. **Build (12 min):**
   - Construct structure
   - Test stability as you build
   - Make adjustments

3. **Test (4 min):**
   - Add weights gradually
   - Record weight held
   - Observe failure point

**Part 3: Analysis (3 minutes)**

- What designs held most weight?

- Where did failures occur?

- What would you change?

- Class discussion

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Sketch your structure (label forces)
2. Record: Weight held = ____
3. Write: "My structure failed because..."
4. Write: "Next time I would..."
5. Draw a famous structure and identify forces

### Closing Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Engineering Insights** — "What surprised you?"
2. **Cathedral Connection** — "How did faith inspire those builders?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for the gift of engineering. May our structures serve people and honor you. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified three types of forces

- [ ] Applied structural principles

- [ ] Built and tested structure

- [ ] Analyzed failure modes

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Partner work

- Simpler materials

- Lower weight goals

### For Advanced Students

- Efficiency ratio (weight held ÷ materials used)

- Multiple design iterations

- Research famous structural failures

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Look for structural engineering in your community! Find bridges, buildings, arches. Where do you see triangles used for strength? Research famous structures like the Eiffel Tower or Golden Gate Bridge!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve KEVA planks from CSCOE

- Have sufficient weights (coins, washers)

- Document with photos

- Connect to local architecture/churches

- Consider field trip to cathedral
