# Session 2: Sphero Advanced 🤖

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 2 of 17

Students explore advanced Sphero BOLT programming using block-based coding with sensors, variables, and conditionals.

---

# Session 2: Sphero Advanced

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Program Sphero BOLT using block programming

- Use sensors (light, compass) in programs

- Implement conditionals and loops

- Create autonomous robot behaviors

---

# Session 2: Sphero Advanced

## Materials Needed

- 🤖 Sphero BOLT robots (from CSCOE library)

- 📱 Tablets with Sphero Edu app

- 📋 Programming challenge cards

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🚧 Course materials

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — Used programming skills to create a database of Eucharistic miracles. Technology for God's glory!

### Scripture
> *"For I know the plans I have for you... plans to prosper you and not to harm you."* — Jeremiah 29:11 (Planning in coding!)

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you gave us minds that can create and program. Help us use technology wisely, like Blessed Carlo Acutis. Guide our coding today! Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Sphero BOLT Features:**
   - LED matrix display
   - Light sensor
   - Compass/gyroscope
   - More precise movement
2. **Block Programming:**
   - Visual coding like Scratch
   - Blocks snap together
   - More complex than drive mode
3. **Blessed Carlo Acutis:**
   - Teen programmer and web developer
   - Used skills to share faith
   - "Be original, not a copy!"
4. **Today's Goal:** Create autonomous Sphero behaviors!

### Main Activity: Block Programming (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Block Programming Intro (8 minutes)**

- Open Sphero Edu app → Blocks mode

- Key block types:
  - **Motion:** Roll, stop, spin
  - **Lights:** LED matrix, main LED
  - **Sounds:** Play sounds
  - **Sensors:** Read light, compass
  - **Controls:** If/then, loops, wait
  - **Variables:** Store values

**Basic Program Demo:**
```
When program starts:
  Set main LED to blue
  Roll at 45° speed 100 for 2 seconds
  Stop
  Set main LED to green
```

**Part 2: Guided Challenges (12 minutes)**

**Challenge 1: Square with Lights (3 min)**

- Roll in a square

- Change LED color at each corner

- Use repeat loop

**Challenge 2: Sensor Response (4 min)**

- Use light sensor

- If dark: Turn on LED matrix (like flashlight!)

- If bright: LED off

- Use conditional (if/else)

**Challenge 3: Compass Navigation (5 min)**

- Roll North for 2 seconds

- Roll East for 2 seconds

- Roll South for 2 seconds

- Roll West for 2 seconds

- Uses heading/compass!

**Part 3: Creative Challenge (8 minutes)**

**Design an Autonomous Behavior:**

- Sphero must make "decisions"

- Use at least one sensor

- Include loops and conditionals

- Ideas:
  - Light-seeking robot
  - Dance that responds to environment
  - Message display sequence

**Part 4: Showcase (2 minutes)**

- Share programs

- Celebrate creativity!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw/write your most complex program
2. Explain what each part does
3. Write: "Conditionals help robots..."
4. Write: "I could use this to..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Discovery Share** — "What was most challenging?"
2. **Carlo's Example** — "How can we use tech for good?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for the gift of programming. Help us use technology to make the world better. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Created block programs

- [ ] Used loops and conditionals

- [ ] Implemented sensor reading

- [ ] Demonstrated logical thinking

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Start with simpler programs

- Pair with experienced peer

- Use step-by-step guides

### For Advanced Students

- Multiple sensor programs

- Create mini-games with Sphero

- Teach concepts to others

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Research Blessed Carlo Acutis! Discuss how technology can serve faith. Try free coding platforms at home: Scratch, Code.org. Think about programs you could create for good!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve Sphero BOLT 2+ weeks ahead

- Sphero BOLT has more features than Sphero Mini

- Ensure full battery charge

- Students will use Sphero again in Session 14
