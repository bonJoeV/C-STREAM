# Session 5: Scratch Advanced 💻

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 5 of 17

Students develop advanced programming skills in Scratch, working with variables, functions, and complex game logic.

---

# Session 5: Scratch Advanced

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Use variables for tracking data

- Create custom blocks (functions)

- Implement complex game logic

- Debug multi-component programs

---

# Session 5: Scratch Advanced

## Materials Needed

- 💻 Computers with Scratch

- 📋 Advanced programming guides

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🖥️ Projector for demonstration

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Thomas Aquinas** — Used rigorous logic to explore faith. Programming requires similar logical thinking!

### Scripture
> *"Come now, let us reason together."* — Isaiah 1:18

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created a universe of order and logic. Help us think clearly and program wisely. May our creations reflect your gift of reason. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Advanced Programming:**
   - "You know the basics—now we level up!"
   - Professional programmers use these concepts daily
2. **Key Concepts Today:**
   - **Variables** — Store and change values
   - **Custom Blocks** — Create reusable code (functions)
   - **Game Logic** — Multiple conditions and responses
3. **St. Thomas Aquinas:**
   - "Faith and reason work together"
   - Logic helps us understand God's world
   - Programming = Applied logic

### Main Activity: Advanced Programming (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Variables Deep Dive (8 minutes)**

**Variable Types:**

- Score, lives, timer, health

- Position tracking

- Game state (playing, won, lost)

**Demo: Score System**
```
When green flag clicked:
  Set [score] to 0
  
When sprite clicked:
  Change [score] by 10
  Play sound [pop]
```

**Practice:** Create variable that:

- Tracks clicks

- Changes with events

- Displays on screen

**Part 2: Custom Blocks (Functions) (8 minutes)**

**Why Custom Blocks?**

- Reuse code (DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Organize complex programs

- Make code readable

**Demo: Create "Move Square" Block**
```
Define [Move Square]:
  Repeat 4:
    Move 50 steps
    Turn 90 degrees

When green flag clicked:
  Move Square
  Move Square
```

**Practice:** Create custom block for:

- Character animation

- Reset position

- Special effect

**Part 3: Complex Game Creation (12 minutes)**

**Build a Complete Game:**

Requirements:

- Player controlled sprite

- Goal or target

- Score tracking

- Win/lose conditions

- Reset functionality

**Suggested: Catching Game**
1. Player moves with mouse/keys
2. Objects fall from top
3. Catch = points, miss = lose life
4. Track score AND lives
5. Game over at 0 lives

**Part 4: Playtesting (2 minutes)**

- Test your game

- Have partner play

- Note bugs to fix

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Write about your custom block
2. Explain your game logic (flowchart if possible)
3. Write: "Variables help games by..."
4. Write: "The hardest bug I fixed was..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Logic Appreciation** — "How did logical thinking help you?"
2. **Debugging Wins** — "What problem did you solve?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for the gift of reason. Help us think clearly and create wisely. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Used variables appropriately

- [ ] Created custom block

- [ ] Implemented game logic

- [ ] Debugged effectively

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Simpler game concept

- Step-by-step guide

- Partner programming

### For Advanced Students

- Multiple levels

- High score saving

- Complex enemy AI

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Share your game with family! Continue developing at home (scratch.mit.edu). Explore other Scratch projects for inspiration. Try the advanced tutorials!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Build on previous Scratch experience

- Allow ongoing development

- Consider class Scratch studio

- Games can be showcased at exhibition
