# Session 02: God's Patterns 🔢

## Overview
**Grades:** 1-2 | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Session:** 2 of 17

Students discover that God built patterns into creation—in math, nature, art, and music—exploring the beautiful order of the universe.

---

# Session 02: God's Patterns

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Identify patterns in nature and everyday life

- Create and extend patterns using different materials

- Understand that patterns show God's order in creation

- Connect mathematical thinking to beauty

---

# Session 02: God's Patterns

## Materials Needed

- 📦 Pattern blocks

- 🌿 Nature items with patterns (pinecones, leaves, flowers)

- 📸 Pictures of patterns in nature (honeycomb, zebra, snowflakes)

- 🎨 Pattern worksheets or paper strips

- 🖍️ Crayons/markers

- 📓 Engineering journals

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Nicolas Steno** — A Catholic scientist who discovered patterns in crystals and rock layers, showing God's order in geology!

### Scripture
> *"He has made everything beautiful in its time."* — Ecclesiastes 3:11

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you made a world full of beautiful patterns—in flowers, snowflakes, and math. Open our eyes to see your wonderful order all around us. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Pattern Hunt** — "What patterns do you notice in our classroom?"
2. **Definition** — "A pattern is something that repeats in a predictable way"
3. **Nature Patterns** — Show pictures:
   - Honeycomb (hexagons)
   - Zebra stripes
   - Flower petals
   - Snowflakes (6 points)
   - Pinecone spirals
4. **Wonder** — "Why do you think God made so many patterns?"

### Main Activity: Pattern Exploration (18 minutes)

**Station Rotation or Whole Group:**

**Part 1: Nature Patterns (5 minutes)**

- Examine real nature items with magnifying glasses

- Pinecone spirals, leaf veins, flower petals

- "What patterns do you see?"

- Count: petals, spirals, sections

**Part 2: Create Patterns (8 minutes)**

- Pattern blocks: Create your own repeating pattern

- Share with partner: "What comes next in my pattern?"

- Challenge patterns:
  - AB pattern (red, blue, red, blue)
  - ABC pattern (red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow)
  - ABB pattern (red, blue, blue, red, blue, blue)

**Part 3: Pattern Art (5 minutes)**

- Create a pattern border on paper

- Draw a nature pattern you observed

- Add color!

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw a pattern you discovered today
2. Create your own pattern design
3. Write: "God's patterns are..."

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Share** — Show one pattern you made or found
2. **Connection** — "Patterns help us predict what comes next—scientists use patterns too!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for the patterns in your beautiful world. Help us notice your order everywhere. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified patterns in nature

- [ ] Created original patterns

- [ ] Extended patterns correctly

- [ ] Connected patterns to God's creation

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on simple AB patterns

- Pre-made pattern starters to complete

- Pair with pattern buddy

### For Advanced Students

- Create complex patterns (AABB, ABCD)

- Growing patterns (1, 2, 3... or square numbers)

- Write about why patterns matter

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Go on a "Pattern Hunt" at home and outside! How many patterns can you find? Look at tiles, fabrics, plants, and animals. Draw your favorite patterns.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Fibonacci sequence appears in pinecones, sunflowers—point this out if students are ready

- Connect to math class pattern work

- Save pattern artwork for display
