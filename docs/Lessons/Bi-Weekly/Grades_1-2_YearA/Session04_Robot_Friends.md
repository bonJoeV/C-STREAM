## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — A young person who used technology to serve God, creating websites to share faith. Technology can be used for good!

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."* — Colossians 3:23

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for creative minds that invent amazing things like robots. Help us use technology wisely and always for good. Bless our learning today. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Robot Wonder** — "What is a robot?"
   - A machine that follows instructions
   - Robots don't think—they do what we TELL them!
2. **Meet Dash** — Introduce the robot
   - Dash has wheels, lights, sounds
   - WE will be the bosses—telling Dash what to do
3. **Instructions Matter** — "Robots only do exactly what we say!"
4. **Today's Goal** — "We're going to program Dash to move!"

### Main Activity: Dash Introduction (19 minutes)

**Part 1: Unplugged Practice (4 minutes)**

- "Robot" game: One student is the robot, one gives commands

- Commands: "Step forward," "Turn right," "Stop"

- Robots only do EXACTLY what you say!

- Lesson: Clear instructions matter!

**Part 2: Meet Dash (5 minutes)**

- Small groups receive Dash Robots and tablets

- Explore: What can Dash do?
   - Move forward/backward
   - Turn
   - Make sounds
   - Light up

- Free exploration time

**Part 3: Drive Challenge (8 minutes)**

- Use "Drive" mode to control Dash

- Challenge 1: Drive in a straight line

- Challenge 2: Drive around an object

- Challenge 3: Drive through a simple path

- Partners take turns driving

**Part 4: Celebrate Success (2 minutes)**

- Show off one cool thing Dash did

- "You just programmed a robot!"

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw Dash the robot
2. Write one instruction you gave Dash
3. Draw the path Dash traveled

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **What We Learned** — "Who is in charge—us or the robot?"
2. **Good Technology Use** — "How can robots help people?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for minds that create and learn. Help us always use technology to help others. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Understood that robots follow instructions

- [ ] Successfully controlled Dash

- [ ] Worked cooperatively with group

- [ ] Recorded learning in journal

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Simplified controls (forward/stop only)

- Extra teacher guidance with tablet

- Partner with experienced peer

### For Advanced Students

- Create own obstacle course

- Program specific sounds with movements

- Try "Wonder" app for more complex coding

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Play "Robot" at home! Give family members robot instructions to follow (be very specific!). Talk about how robots are used in the world—cars, vacuums, factories, medicine.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve Dash Robots from CSCOE 2 weeks ahead

- Charge robots overnight before use

- Go app is simpler; Wonder app is more advanced

- Set clear expectations for robot handling
