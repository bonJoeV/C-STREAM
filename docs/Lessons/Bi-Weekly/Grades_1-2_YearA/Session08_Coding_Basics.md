## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — A young Catholic who used coding and computers to share faith. He created websites about Eucharistic miracles!

### Scripture
> *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God."* — John 1:1
> (Just as God speaks creation into being, we speak instructions to computers!)

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for creative minds that made computers and coding. Help us use technology to do good things. May we be like Blessed Carlo Acutis, using our skills for you. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **What is Coding?** — "Giving step-by-step instructions to a computer"
2. **Connection to Robots** — "Remember Dash? Same idea!"
3. **ScratchJr** — "This app lets us code stories and games"
4. **Blessed Carlo Acutis** — Teen who coded for God
5. **Today's Goal** — "Make a character move!"

### Main Activity: ScratchJr Exploration (19 minutes)

**Part 1: App Tour (4 minutes)**

- Open ScratchJr

- Explore interface:
  - Character (Cat)
  - Stage (background)
  - Blocks (instructions)
  - Green flag (start)

- "The blocks are like puzzle pieces that tell the character what to do"

**Part 2: First Program (8 minutes)**

- Guided tutorial:
  1. Add "Start on Green Flag" block
  2. Add "Move Right" block
  3. Tap green flag—watch cat move!
  4. Add more move blocks
  5. Try: Up, down, left

- Challenge: Make cat walk across the screen

**Part 3: Personalize (5 minutes)**

- Change background

- Try different character

- Add sounds or speech bubbles

- Free creation time

**Part 4: Share (2 minutes)**

- Show neighbor what you made

- "You just wrote a computer program!"

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw the ScratchJr character you used
2. Write or draw the instructions you gave
3. Circle: Easy 😊 or Tricky 🔧

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Celebration** — "You are now CODERS!"
2. **Next Time** — "We'll learn more coding tricks!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for the gift of learning. Help us use coding and technology for good things. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Opened ScratchJr and explored

- [ ] Created program with motion

- [ ] Used green flag to run program

- [ ] Showed willingness to try

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-made starter project to modify

- Partner with experienced peer

- Focus on one block type (motion)

### For Advanced Students

- Add loops (repeat blocks)

- Create multi-scene story

- Help classmates who are stuck

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** If you have a tablet, try ScratchJr at home! (Free app) Create a story together. No tablet? Play "programmer"—give family members step-by-step instructions to do something!

---

## Teacher Notes

- ScratchJr is free for iPad and Android

- Pre-install and test app before session

- Consider projecting tablet for demonstrations

- Common issue: Blocks not snapping together—show how to connect
