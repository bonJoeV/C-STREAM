## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Vincent de Paul** — He organized help for the poor, creating systems to serve those in need.

### Scripture
> *"Serve one another humbly in love."* — Galatians 5:13

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you call us to love our neighbors. Help us see what our community needs. Give us creative ideas to help others. Bless the work of our hands. Amen.*

**Part 3: Share Plans (2 minutes)**

- Groups share what they designed

- "How will this help?"

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw your design
2. Write: "This helps... by..."
3. Write: "One thing I can do this week to help someone is..."

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Service Summary** — "How can engineers help communities?"
