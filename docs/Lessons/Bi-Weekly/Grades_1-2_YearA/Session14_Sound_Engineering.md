# Session 14: Sound Engineering 🎵

## Overview
**Grades:** 1-2 | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Session:** 14 of 17

Students explore the science of sound and engineer their own musical instruments to praise God.

---

# Session 14: Sound Engineering

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand that sound is made by vibrations

- Experiment with pitch (high/low) and volume (loud/soft)

- Design and build a simple instrument

- Connect music to praising God

---

# Session 14: Sound Engineering

## Materials Needed

- 📦 Rubber bands (various sizes)

- 📦 Boxes, containers, cardboard tubes

- 📦 Rice, beans (for shakers)

- 📦 Paper, plastic cups

- 🎵 Simple instruments for demonstration

- 📓 Engineering journals

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Cecilia** — Patron saint of music! She sang to God even in difficult times.

### Scripture
> *"Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet, praise him with the harp and lyre... praise him with strings and pipe."* — Psalm 150:3-4

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for the gift of sound and music. Help us use music to praise you! Like St. Cecilia, may our songs bring joy to heaven. Amen.*

---

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Sound Investigation** — "What IS sound?"
2. **Vibration Demo:**
   - Pluck rubber band — see it shake!
   - Touch throat while humming — feel vibration!
   - "Sound happens when things VIBRATE"
3. **High/Low:** — Different vibration speeds = different pitches
4. **Loud/Soft:** — Big vibrations = loud; small = soft
5. **Today's Goal** — "Build an instrument to praise God!"

### Main Activity: Instrument Engineering (19 minutes)

**Part 1: Sound Exploration (4 minutes)**

- Try different sound makers:
  - Pluck rubber bands of different sizes
  - Shake containers with different contents
  - Blow across bottle tops

- "What do you notice?"

- Compare pitches and volumes

**Part 2: Design & Build (12 minutes)**

**Option A: Rubber Band Guitar**

- Stretch rubber bands around a box

- Try different band sizes

- Pluck to make music

**Option B: Shaker**

- Put rice/beans in container

- Seal securely

- Decorate!

**Option C: Drum**

- Stretch balloon over cup/can

- Tap with pencil/straw

- Try different sizes

**Option D: Kazoo**

- Paper tube + wax paper

- Secure wax paper on end with rubber band

- Hum into open end


- All students: Test and improve your instrument

**Part 3: Praise Band (3 minutes)**

- All play instruments together

- Follow teacher's conducting (loud, soft, fast, slow)

- Sing a simple praise song while playing

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw your instrument
2. Label the parts
3. Write: "Sound is made by..."
4. Write: "I praise God by..."

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Sound Science** — "What makes sound?"
2. **Praise Connection** — "God loves when we make joyful noise!"
3. **Closing Prayer + Music** — Play instruments while praying: *"Thank you, God, for sound and music! Alleluia! Amen!"*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Understood vibration creates sound

- [ ] Built a working instrument

- [ ] Experimented with pitch/volume

- [ ] Connected music to praising God

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-made instrument to decorate

- Focus on one instrument type

- Partner building

### For Advanced Students

- Build multiple instruments

- Explain the science behind their design

- Create a band with different sounds

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Make instruments at home using household items! Experiment with pots and pans, rubber bands and boxes, containers with different fillings. Have a family praise concert!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Consider keeping instruments for future use

- Great connection to music class

- Psalm 150 lists many instruments—explore together

- Digital music connection: simple music apps (GarageBand, Chrome Music Lab)
