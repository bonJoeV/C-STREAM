# Session 10: Weather Watchers 🌦️

## Overview
**Grades:** 1-2 | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Session:** 10 of 17

Students become meteorologists, observing and recording weather data and building simple weather instruments.

# Session 10: Weather Watchers

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Identify different types of weather

- Record weather observations systematically

- Build a simple weather tool

- Understand that scientists study God's patterns in weather

---

# Session 10: Weather Watchers

## Materials Needed

- 📋 Weather chart/calendar

- 🌡️ Outdoor thermometer

- 🎐 Windsock materials (paper, string, streamers)

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📸 Pictures of weather types

- ☁️ Cloud chart

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Scholastica** — According to legend, she prayed and God sent a storm so she could keep talking with her brother (St. Benedict) about faith!

### Scripture
> *"He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses."* — Psalm 135:7

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you control the weather—the sun, rain, snow, and wind. Thank you for the patterns you built into nature. Help us learn about your amazing world. Keep us safe in all weather. Amen.*

---

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Today's Weather** — Look outside. "What's the weather today?"
2. **Weather Types:**
   - ☀️ Sunny
   - ☁️ Cloudy
   - 🌧️ Rainy
   - ❄️ Snowy
   - 💨 Windy
3. **Meteorologists** — Scientists who study weather
4. **God's Patterns** — Weather follows patterns God designed
5. **Today's Goal** — "We're going to be weather scientists!"

### Main Activity: Weather Station (19 minutes)

**Part 1: Weather Observation (5 minutes)**

- Go outside or observe from window

- Record on chart:
  - Temperature (read thermometer together)
  - Cloud cover (sunny, partly cloudy, cloudy)
  - Wind (calm, breezy, windy)
  - Precipitation (none, rain, snow)

- "Scientists record what they observe!"

**Part 2: Cloud Study (4 minutes)**

- Look at clouds

- Cloud types (simplified):
  - Fluffy clouds = fair weather
  - Flat gray clouds = might rain
  - Wispy high clouds = weather changing

- Draw the clouds you see

**Part 3: Build a Windsock (8 minutes)**

- Materials: Paper tube/cup, streamers, string

- Steps:
  1. Attach streamers to one end of tube
  2. Add string for hanging
  3. Decorate!

- "This tool shows us wind direction!"

- Test by window or briefly outside

**Part 4: Weather Prediction (2 minutes)**

- Based on observations: "What do you think weather will be like tomorrow?"

- "Scientists make predictions based on patterns!"

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw today's weather
2. Record temperature
3. Draw your windsock
4. Predict tomorrow's weather

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Weather Wonder** — "What amazes you about weather?"
2. **God's Care** — "God sends rain for plants and sunshine for warmth"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for weather that waters the earth and gives us seasons. Help us appreciate every kind of day you give us. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified weather conditions

- [ ] Recorded observations

- [ ] Built windsock

- [ ] Made weather prediction

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on three weather types

- Pre-made windsock base

- Partner observation

### For Advanced Students

- Record multiple data points

- Compare to weather forecast

- Research cloud types

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Start a family weather journal! Record the weather each day for a week. Hang your windsock outside and watch it. Compare your observations to the weather forecast—how accurate were you?

---

## Teacher Notes

- Start ongoing classroom weather tracking if possible

- Windsocks can be hung in classroom or sent home

- Connect to daily calendar weather activities

- Great springboard for water cycle discussions
