**St. Martin de Porres** — He served the poor and sick with great love, giving food and care to everyone in need.

### Scripture
> *"Give thanks in all circumstances."* — 1 Thessalonians 5:18

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, we have so much to be thankful for! Help us share our blessings with others. Like St. Martin de Porres, may we serve with love. Amen.*
