# Session 03: Bridge Building 🌉

## Overview
**Grades:** 1-2 | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Session:** 3 of 17

Students design and build bridges, learning about structural engineering while exploring how bridges connect communities.

---

# Session 03: Bridge Building

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand the purpose of bridges (connecting, crossing)

- Identify basic bridge types (beam, arch)

- Design and build a bridge that spans a gap

- Test their bridge design with weight

---

# Session 03: Bridge Building

## Materials Needed

- 📦 KEVA Planks

- 📦 Craft sticks and tape

- 📦 Paper (for folding experiments)

- 📏 Two books or blocks (to create gap)

- 🪙 Pennies or small weights for testing

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📸 Pictures of different bridges

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. John Nepomucene** — Patron saint of bridges! He stood for truth and is often shown on bridges throughout Europe.

### Scripture
> *"Let us build bridges, not walls."* — Pope Francis (quoting Jesus's call to reconciliation)

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you want us to connect with others and build bridges of friendship. Help us design strong bridges today and be bridges of kindness to everyone we meet. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Why Bridges?** — "What do bridges do?"
   - Help us cross water, valleys, roads
   - Connect communities
   - Help people get to school, work, church
2. **Bridge Types** — Show pictures:
   - Beam bridge (flat across)
   - Arch bridge (curved support)
   - Suspension bridge (hanging cables)
3. **Today's Challenge** — "Build a bridge that crosses this gap!"

### Main Activity: Bridge Engineering (19 minutes)

**Part 1: Paper Experiment (4 minutes)**

- Can a flat piece of paper hold a penny? (No, it flops)

- Fold paper into an accordion—now try (Yes!)

- "Shapes give paper strength!"

**Part 2: Design & Plan (3 minutes)**

- Set up gap (two books, ~8 inches apart)

- Partners discuss: "How will we build across?"

- Quick sketch in journal

**Part 3: Build & Test (10 minutes)**

- Materials: KEVA Planks or craft sticks and tape

- Build bridge across the gap

- Must span the entire gap without support in middle

- Test with pennies: How many can it hold?

- When it breaks: "What can we change?"

- Rebuild and improve!

**Part 4: Celebrate (2 minutes)**

- Share strongest bridges

- Discuss: "What made these bridges strong?"

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw your bridge design
2. Record: How many pennies did it hold?
3. Draw an improvement you would make

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Engineering Discovery** — "What makes bridges strong?"
2. **Faith Connection** — "How can WE be bridges to others?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for bridges that connect us. Help us build bridges of love and friendship. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Participated in design process

- [ ] Built a bridge that spanned the gap

- [ ] Tested and tried to improve

- [ ] Recorded observations in journal

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Narrower gap to span

- Pre-built base to work from

- Teacher nearby for guidance

### For Advanced Students

- Wider gap to span

- Weight challenge (most pennies wins)

- Design two different bridge types

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Look for bridges in your community—over roads, rivers, or walking paths. What type are they? Build bridges at home using craft sticks, blocks, or even spaghetti and marshmallows!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Save successful bridge designs for display

- KEVA Planks work great for beam bridges

- Craft sticks + tape allow more creativity

- Consider video of famous bridges
