# Session 15: Robot Challenge 🤖

## Overview
**Grades:** 1-2 | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Session:** 15 of 17

Students use their Dash Robot skills from earlier to complete mission challenges, demonstrating growth in programming concepts.

# Session 15: Robot Challenge

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Apply programming skills to solve challenges

- Program a sequence of movements

- Problem-solve when code doesn't work (debugging)

- Collaborate on robot missions

---

# Session 15: Robot Challenge

## Materials Needed

- 📦 Dash Robots (from CSCOE library)

- 📱 Tablets with Go/Wonder app

- 📋 Mission challenge cards

- 🚧 Obstacle materials (cups, blocks, tape)

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🏁 Tape for start/finish lines

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Thomas Aquinas** — He believed in using reason and problem-solving to understand God's world. "Logic is God's gift!"

### Scripture
> *"For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength."* — Philippians 4:13

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for giving us problem-solving minds. When things don't work, help us try again. Give us patience and creativity as we work with our robot friends today. Amen.*

---

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Robot Review** — "Remember Dash? We're experts now!"
2. **Challenge Day** — "Today you'll complete MISSIONS!"
3. **Programming Review:**
   - Robots follow our instructions exactly
   - We can drive OR we can program sequences
4. **Growth Mindset** — "If it doesn't work, that's a learning chance!"

### Main Activity: Robot Mission Challenges (20 minutes)

**Mission Setup:** Create course with tape lines and obstacles

**Part 1: Review & Practice (3 minutes)**

- Quick refresh of Dash controls

- Practice driving forward and turning

- Try "Path" mode for programming sequences

**Part 2: Mission Challenges (15 minutes)**

**Mission 1: Straight Shot** (3 min)

- Program Dash to drive from START to FINISH line

- No driving—must use programming!

- Goal: Accurate straight line

**Mission 2: Turn Around** (4 min)

- Program Dash to go forward, turn around, come back

- Requires forward, turn 180°, forward

**Mission 3: Obstacle Course** (5 min)

- Navigate around cups or blocks

- Requires turns and distance planning

- Teams collaborate to solve

**Mission 4: Creative Challenge** (3 min)

- "Program Dash to do something cool!"

- Add sounds, lights

- Share with class

**Part 3: Celebration (2 minutes)**

- Teams share favorite accomplishments

- Discuss: "What was tricky? How did you solve it?"

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw one mission you completed
2. Write: "The hardest part was..."
3. Write: "I solved it by..."
4. Rate your programming: Beginner → Expert!

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Growth Celebration** — "Look how much you've learned!"
2. **Problem-Solving** — "What did you do when it didn't work?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for letting us solve problems and learn new things. Help us use technology wisely. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Completed at least two missions

- [ ] Used programming (not just driving)

- [ ] Problem-solved when stuck

- [ ] Collaborated with team

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Simplified missions (shorter distances)

- Partner with experienced programmer

- Focus on driving with some programming

### For Advanced Students

- Create own mission course

- Use Wonder app for complex programs

- Mentor other students

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Talk about robots at home! Where do we see robots? (Vacuums, car factories, space exploration) If you have a tablet, try ScratchJr to practice programming. Give family members "robot" commands to follow!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve Dash Robots 2 weeks ahead

- Charge all robots night before

- Have backup activities if tech fails

- This session shows growth from Session 4
