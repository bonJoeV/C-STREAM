## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Kateri Tekakwitha** — The first Native American saint, she loved nature and saw God's beauty in all creation.

### Scripture
> *"Ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds in the sky, and they will tell you."* — Job 12:7

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for the beautiful world outside our door. Open our eyes to see the amazing things you've made. Help us be good scientists who notice and wonder. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Scientist Observation** — "Scientists look carefully and ask questions"
2. **Living vs. Non-Living:**
   - Living: grows, needs food/water, can reproduce (plants, animals)
   - Non-living: doesn't grow, doesn't need food (rocks, water, air)
3. **Today's Mission** — "We're going to be nature scientists!"
4. **Rules Review** — Stay together, observe don't disturb, be gentle

### Main Activity: Nature Investigation (20 minutes)

**Option A: Outdoor Exploration (weather permitting)**

**Part 1: Observation Walk (8 minutes)**

- Walk slowly around school grounds

- Notice: What do you see? Hear? Smell?

- Look for:
  - Living things (plants, insects, birds)
  - Non-living things (rocks, water, man-made)
  - Signs of animals (tracks, nests, holes)

- Use magnifying glasses for close-ups

**Part 2: Recording (7 minutes)**

- Stop at a spot to draw and write

- Journal pages:
  - Draw 2 living things you found
  - Draw 2 non-living things you found
  - Write one "I wonder..." question

**Part 3: Collection (5 minutes)**

- Collect ONE nature item (already fallen—don't pick living plants)

- Bring back to share

**Option B: Indoor Investigation (inclement weather)**

- Nature items brought inside

- Nature videos/photos

- Window observations

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Complete observation drawings
2. Label: Living (L) or Non-living (NL)
3. Write biggest discovery

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Share Collections** — What did you find?
2. **Questions** — Share "I wonder..." questions
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for every leaf, bug, and rock in your creation. Help us take care of this beautiful world. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Participated in outdoor exploration

- [ ] Correctly identified living/non-living

- [ ] Recorded observations in journal

- [ ] Asked questions about nature

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Observation partner

- Checklist of things to find (with pictures)

- Focus on drawing rather than writing

### For Advanced Students

- Record multiple "I wonder" questions

- Classify items in more detail

- Start a nature collection

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Take a nature walk in your neighborhood or at a park. Bring a journal and draw what you see. Collect items (that are already on the ground) for a nature display at home.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Scout location before lesson

- Have backup indoor plan ready

- Remind students about insect safety, plant allergies

- Great connection to science curriculum
