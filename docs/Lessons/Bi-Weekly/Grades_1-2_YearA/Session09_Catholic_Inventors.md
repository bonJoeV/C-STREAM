## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Multiple Catholic Scientists:**

- **Gregor Mendel** — Monk who discovered genetics

- **Louis Pasteur** — Catholic who invented pasteurization

- **Fr. Georges Lemaître** — Priest who proposed the Big Bang theory

### Scripture
> *"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."* — Psalm 19:1

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for our Catholic school where we learn about you AND about your world. Thank you for Catholic scientists who loved you and loved learning. Help us follow their example. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Catholic Schools Week!** — "We're celebrating our school!"
2. **Faith + Science** — "At Catholic schools, we learn that God made science!"
3. **Catholic Scientists** — Introduce heroes:
   - **Gregor Mendel:** Monk who grew pea plants and discovered how traits pass from parents to children (genetics)
   - **Louis Pasteur:** Made milk safe to drink (pasteurization)
   - **Fr. Georges Lemaître:** Priest who figured out the universe is expanding (Big Bang)
4. **Key Message** — "Loving God and loving science go together!"

### Main Activity: Catholic Scientist Celebration (18 minutes)

**Part 1: Meet a Scientist (6 minutes)**

- Focus on ONE scientist in depth (Gregor Mendel recommended for 1-2)

- "Brother Mendel was a monk—he prayed every day"

- "He was curious about God's creation"

- "He grew thousands of pea plants!"

- "He discovered that children look like their parents because of tiny instructions (genes)"

- Discussion: "What made him a good scientist AND a good Catholic?"

**Part 2: Create a Tribute (10 minutes)**

- **Option A: Scientist Poster**
  - Draw the scientist
  - Write one fact
  - Add: "Catholic Scientist!"
  

- **Option B: Pea Plant Activity** (Mendel connection)
  - Sort items by traits (like Mendel did)
  - Big/small, green/yellow
  - Connect to Mendel's work


- **Option C: Thank You to Teachers**
  - Create cards for school teachers
  - "Thank you for teaching us about God and science!"

**Part 3: Share (2 minutes)**

- Show creations

- Say one thing learned about Catholic scientists

### Engineering Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw your favorite Catholic scientist
2. Write: "I learned that..."
3. Write: "I'm thankful for my Catholic school because..."

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **School Pride** — "What's special about our Catholic school?"
2. **Future Scientists** — "You can be a Catholic scientist too!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for faith and science together. Thank you for our Catholic school. Help us love learning and love you. Amen."*
