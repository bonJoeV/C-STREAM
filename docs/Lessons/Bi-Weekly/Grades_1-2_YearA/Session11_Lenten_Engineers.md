### Saint Connection
**St. Katherine Drexel** — She gave away her fortune to serve others, especially building schools for children who didn't have them.

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."* — Matthew 25:40

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, during Lent we remember your sacrifice for us. Help us give up something to help others. Show us how to use our hands and minds to serve. Amen.*
