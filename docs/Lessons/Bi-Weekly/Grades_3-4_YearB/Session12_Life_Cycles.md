# Session 12: Life Cycles 🦋

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 12 of 17

Students explore various animal life cycles, discovering patterns in God's design for growth and transformation.

---

# Session 12: Life Cycles

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Compare different animal life cycles

- Understand complete and incomplete metamorphosis

- Create life cycle models

- Connect transformation to resurrection themes

---

# Session 12: Life Cycles

## Materials Needed

- 📸 Life cycle diagrams (various animals)

- 🎨 Model creation materials

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🦋 Butterfly specimens or images

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Easter Theme** — Life cycles remind us of resurrection: death leads to new life, transformation brings glory!

### Scripture
> *"Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds."* — John 12:24

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you designed life to grow and transform. Thank you for the miracle of life cycles. Help us see your resurrection power in all of creation. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **What is a Life Cycle?**
   - "The stages a living thing goes through from birth to death"
   - Pattern repeats generation after generation
2. **Two Types of Metamorphosis:**
   - **Complete:** Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult (butterfly)
   - **Incomplete:** Egg → Nymph → Adult (grasshopper)
3. **Transformation:**
   - Caterpillar → Butterfly
   - "Completely different creature!"
4. **Easter Connection:**
   - Death → New life
   - Old passes away, new comes!

### Main Activity: Life Cycle Exploration (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Compare Life Cycles (8 minutes)**

**Complete Metamorphosis:**

- Butterfly: Egg → Caterpillar → Chrysalis → Butterfly

- Frog: Egg → Tadpole → Froglet → Frog

- Total transformation!

**Incomplete Metamorphosis:**

- Grasshopper: Egg → Nymph (small adult) → Adult

- Dragonfly: Egg → Nymph → Adult

- Gradual change!

**Other Cycles:**

- Mammal: Birth → Youth → Adult → Parent

- Bird: Egg → Chick → Adult

- Fish: Egg → Larva → Adult

**Discussion:**

- What patterns do you notice?

- What's similar? Different?

- Why do you think God designed these patterns?

**Part 2: Create Life Cycle Model (14 minutes)**

**Choose an Animal:**

- Butterfly (most dramatic)

- Frog

- Chicken

- Or another approved animal

**Create Your Model:**

- Options:
  - 3D stages from clay or paper
  - Circular diagram with arrows
  - Flip book showing transformation
  - Digital slideshow

**Include:**

- All stages clearly shown

- Labels for each stage

- Arrows showing progression

- Time information if known

**Part 3: Share & Compare (4 minutes)**

- Gallery walk or presentations

- "What did you discover?"

- Compare different animals

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your animal's life cycle (label stages)
2. Write: "Metamorphosis means..."
3. Write: "Life cycles show God's design because..."
4. Write: "This reminds me of Easter because..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Transformation Wonder** — "What amazes you about metamorphosis?"
2. **Easter Preview** — "How is resurrection like metamorphosis?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for transformation and new life. As Easter approaches, help us be transformed by your love. Amen."*

- Template provided

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Compare multiple animals

- Research unusual life cycles

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Observe life cycles around you! Watch tadpoles or caterpillars if available. Research animal life cycles online. Discuss: How does transformation connect to our faith journey?

---

## Teacher Notes

- Consider raising butterflies or tadpoles
