- Design a compound machine concept

---

# Session 15: Compound Machines

## Materials Needed

- 📸 Pictures of compound machines

- 📦 Building materials

- 🔍 Real compound machines (scissors, can opener)

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📋 Simple machine reference cards

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Joseph the Worker** — Patron of workers! His carpentry required compound machines like planes and drills.

### Scripture
> *"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might."* — Ecclesiastes 9:10

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for tools that help us work. Like St. Joseph who worked with skill and dedication, help us appreciate the engineering of compound machines. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Simple Machine Review:**
   - Lever, Inclined Plane, Wedge, Screw, Wheel & Axle, Pulley
   - Each makes work easier in one way
2. **Compound Machines:**
   - "What if we combine them?"
   - Two or more simple machines working together
   - More power, more possibilities!
3. **Examples:**
   - Scissors = 2 levers + 2 wedges
   - Bicycle = wheels, levers, pulleys
   - Wheelbarrow = lever + wheel
4. **St. Joseph** — Used compound tools in his workshop

### Main Activity: Compound Machine Discovery (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Machine Analysis (10 minutes)**

**Examine Real Compound Machines:**

- **Scissors**
  - Find the levers (handles)
  - Find the wedges (blades)
  - How do they work together?


- **Can Opener**
  - Wheel & axle (turning knob)
  - Wedge (cutting wheel)
  - Lever (handles)


- **Pencil Sharpener**
  - Wheel & axle (handle)
  - Wedge (blades)
  - Screw (holds blade)


- **Other examples to find:**
  - Stapler
  - Hole punch
  - Bike (if available)
  - Door knob

**Record:**

- Name of machine

- Simple machines inside

- How they work together

**Part 2: Design Challenge (12 minutes)**

**Challenge:** Design a NEW compound machine!

**Requirements:**

- Combines at least 2 simple machines

- Serves a useful purpose

- Sketch with labels

- Explain how it works

**Ideas:**

- Helper for someone with a need

- Tool for a specific job

- Improvement on existing machine

- Solve a classroom problem

**Process:**
1. Identify problem/need (2 min)
2. Brainstorm solutions (2 min)
3. Design compound machine (6 min)
4. Label simple machines used (2 min)

**Part 3: Design Share (4 minutes)**

- Share designs with class

- Explain: What simple machines? What does it do?

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. List the 6 simple machines
2. Draw a compound machine you examined (label parts)
3. Draw your design (label simple machines)
4. Write: "Compound machines are powerful because..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Machine Appreciation** — "Look at compound machines around you now!"
2. **St. Joseph Connection** — "Workers need good tools!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for the creativity to combine simple things into powerful tools. Help us work with skill and purpose. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified simple machines in compound machines

- [ ] Analyzed real compound machines

- [ ] Designed original compound machine

- [ ] Explained how parts work together

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on scissors analysis

- Partner design work

- Design template provided

### For Advanced Students

- Build working prototype

- Calculate mechanical advantage

- Research complex machines

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Compound machine hunt at home! Find 10 compound machines and identify the simple machines inside each. Kitchen tools, garage tools, toys—they're everywhere! Try designing one together!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Bring real tools for examination

- Safety with sharp objects (scissors, can opener)

- Great for St. Joseph the Worker feast day (May 1)

- Consider Rube Goldberg machine extension
