# Session 3: Tower Challenge 🏗️

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 3 of 17

Students explore structural engineering by building tall towers using KEVA planks, testing height and stability.

---

# Session 3: Tower Challenge

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand principles of tall structure stability

- Apply engineering concepts: base, center of gravity

- Build and test tower structures

- Iterate and improve designs

---

# Session 3: Tower Challenge

## Materials Needed

- 📦 KEVA Planks (from CSCOE library)

- 📏 Measuring tape

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📸 Camera for documentation

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Tower of Babel Reflection** — The Bible story reminds us that our building should glorify God, not ourselves. We build to SERVE!

### Scripture
> *"Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain."* — Psalm 127:1

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you are the master architect of creation. Help us build structures that serve others and give glory to you. Guide our engineering today. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Tall Structures:**
   - "Why do people build tall?"
   - Examples: Burj Khalifa, Empire State Building, church spires
2. **Engineering Principles:**
   - **Wide Base** — Distributes weight
   - **Center of Gravity** — Keep it balanced
   - **Symmetry** — Equal on all sides
   - **Triangles** — Add strength
3. **Tower of Babel:**
   - Built for pride, not service
   - Our towers serve people and honor God
4. **Challenge** — "Build the tallest stable tower!"

### Main Activity: Tower Engineering (26 minutes)

**Part 1: The Challenge (3 minutes)**

- Build the tallest FREESTANDING tower

- Must stand for 10 seconds

- Only KEVA planks—no tape, glue, etc.

- Work in pairs

**Part 2: Design & Build (18 minutes)**

**Design Phase (3 min):**

- Sketch tower design

- Think: How will it be stable?

- Plan base structure

**Build Phase (12 min):**

- Start building!

- Remember: Wide base, balanced design

- Test stability as you go

- If it falls—learn and rebuild!

**Measurement (3 min):**

- Final measurement (must stand 10 seconds)

- Record heights

- Document what worked

**Part 3: Analysis (5 minutes)**

- Compare towers:
  - What design features do the tallest share?
  - What caused towers to fall?

- Class discussion: Design principles discovered

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your tower design (before and after)
2. Record: "My tower reached ___ inches/cm"
3. Write: "The most important design principle is..."
4. Write: "If I did this again, I would..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Height Records** — Celebrate tallest and most creative!
2. **Service Focus** — "How do tall buildings serve people?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, may everything we build serve others and give glory to you. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Applied stability principles

- [ ] Built freestanding structure

- [ ] Iterated after failures

- [ ] Analyzed successful designs

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Starter base structure

- Partner with experienced builder

- Lower height goal

### For Advanced Students

- Height + weight-bearing challenge

- Limited plank count

- Design constraints (specific base size)

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Build towers at home with playing cards, blocks, or other materials! Research the tallest buildings in the world. What makes them stable? Visit a tall building or church steeple!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve KEVA planks from CSCOE

- Clear large floor/table space

- Document with photos

- Consider class tower record board

- Great for collaboration skills
