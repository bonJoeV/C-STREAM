# Session 4: Ecosystems 🌿

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 4 of 17

Students explore ecosystems and food webs, understanding how all living things are connected in God's design.

---

# Session 4: Ecosystems

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Define ecosystem, food chain, and food web

- Identify producers, consumers, and decomposers

- Create a food web for a local ecosystem

- Appreciate the interconnection of all creation

---

# Session 4: Ecosystems

## Materials Needed

- 📸 Ecosystem pictures

- 🧶 Yarn for food web activity

- 📋 Organism cards

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🎨 Food web poster materials

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Kateri Tekakwitha** — Lily of the Mohawks, lived in harmony with nature and saw God in all creation.

### Scripture
> *"For in him all things hold together."* — Colossians 1:17

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created an amazing world where everything is connected. Help us see your wisdom in ecosystems and be good stewards of your creation. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Ecosystem Definition:**
   - "A community of living things interacting with their environment"
   - All living + non-living things work together
2. **Key Vocabulary:**
   - **Producer** — Makes own food (plants)
   - **Consumer** — Eats others for energy
   - **Decomposer** — Breaks down dead things
3. **Food Chain vs Web:**
   - Chain: Single path of energy (grass → rabbit → fox)
   - Web: Multiple connected chains (more realistic!)
4. **St. Kateri** — Saw God's design in nature

### Main Activity: Food Web Exploration (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Food Chain Building (6 minutes)**

- Start simple: sun → producer → consumer → decomposer

- Minnesota examples:
  - Sun → grass → deer → wolf → bacteria
  - Sun → algae → minnow → bass → eagle

- Energy flows from sun through all living things!

**Part 2: Food Web Game (10 minutes)**

- Students receive organism cards (plants, animals, decomposers)

- Stand in circle

- Pass yarn to show connections:
  - "I am a plant, I'm eaten by..." → pass yarn
  - Continue building web

- Everyone holds yarn—see the connections!

- What happens if one organism is removed? (Pull yarn—see effects!)

**Part 3: Create Food Web Poster (8 minutes)**

- Choose ecosystem: forest, prairie, wetland, pond

- Draw food web showing:
  - At least 3 producers
  - At least 4 consumers
  - At least 2 decomposers
  - Arrows showing energy flow

- Label: Producer, Consumer, Decomposer

**Part 4: Share & Discuss (2 minutes)**

- Show webs

- "What happens if _____ disappears?"

- Everything is connected!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw a simple food chain (4 organisms)
2. Label: Producer, Consumer, Decomposer
3. Write: "Everything is connected because..."
4. Write: "We should protect ecosystems because..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Connection Appreciation** — "What surprised you about food webs?"
2. **Stewardship** — "How can we protect ecosystems?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, your creation is beautifully connected. Help us protect the web of life you designed. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Defined ecosystem vocabulary

- [ ] Participated in food web game

- [ ] Created accurate food web

- [ ] Understood interconnection

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-made organism cards with labels

- Simplified food web

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Research specific ecosystem

- Include energy percentages

- Create disruption scenario analysis

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Create a food web for your backyard or local park! What plants grow there? What animals live there? Research what eats what. Watch nature documentaries about ecosystems!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Food web yarn activity is powerful visual

- Pull yarn to show cascade effects

- Connect to environmental stewardship

- Consider outdoor observation if possible
