# Session 2: Ozobot Coding 🤖

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 2 of 17

Students discover Ozobot robots and learn to program them using color codes and OzoBlockly.

---

# Session 2: Ozobot Coding

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand how Ozobot follows lines and reads color codes

- Program Ozobot using color code commands

- Create simple OzoBlockly programs

- Debug programs that don't work

---

# Session 2: Ozobot Coding

## Materials Needed

- 🤖 Ozobot robots (from CSCOE library)

- 🖊️ Thick markers (black, red, blue, green)

- 📄 White paper for tracks

- 💻 Devices for OzoBlockly (optional)

- 📓 Engineering journals

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — Young tech enthusiast who used his skills for God's glory!

### Scripture
> *"Direct my footsteps according to your word."* — Psalm 119:133

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you guide our paths. As we program robots to follow lines, help us remember to follow your way. Thank you for technology and creativity. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Meet Ozobot:**
   - "Tiny robot that follows lines and reads colors!"
   - Has sensors on bottom to detect colors
   - No remote needed—it thinks!
2. **How It Works:**
   - Follows black lines
   - Color codes give commands
   - Different color patterns = different actions
3. **Blessed Carlo** — Used tech to spread faith!

### Main Activity: Ozobot Exploration (27 minutes)

**Part 1: Line Following (7 minutes)**

- Draw black line on white paper

- Place Ozobot on line—watch it go!

- Try:
  - Straight lines
  - Curves
  - Intersections (what happens?)

- Key: Lines must be thick enough!

**Part 2: Color Codes (10 minutes)**

**Introduction to OzoCodes:**

- Specific color patterns give commands

- Must be drawn in correct order

- Reference card shows all codes

**Essential Codes to Try:**

- 🔴⬛🔴⬛ (Red-Black-Red-Black) = U-Turn

- 🔵🟢🔵 (Blue-Green-Blue) = Spin

- 🔴🔵🔴 (Red-Blue-Red) = Speed up (Turbo)

- 🟢⬛🟢 (Green-Black-Green) = Slow down

- 🔵🔴🔵 (Blue-Red-Blue) = Turn around

**Practice:**

- Add codes to your track

- Test each one

- Create track with multiple commands

**Part 3: Course Design (8 minutes)**

- Design a complete Ozobot course

- Include:
  - Start point
  - At least 3 turns
  - At least 2 color codes
  - End point

- Test and refine!

**Part 4: Course Share (2 minutes)**

- Try a classmate's course

- Share successes and challenges

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw an Ozobot on a line
2. Write/draw 3 color codes you learned
3. Draw your course design
4. Write: "Debugging means..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Discovery Share** — "What surprised you about Ozobot?"
2. **Following Paths** — "How do WE follow God's path?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for guiding us. Help us follow your way. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Understood line-following concept

- [ ] Successfully used color codes

- [ ] Created working course

- [ ] Debugged problems

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-drawn line templates

- Focus on basic codes

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- OzoBlockly programming

- Complex course design

- Create challenges for others

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Ozobot has free resources at ozobot.com! Print color code sheets and practice at home if you have markers. Think about how robots "see" and "decide"—it's all programming!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve Ozobots from CSCOE library

- Ensure thick black markers (fine lines won't work)

- Charge Ozobots fully before class

- OzoBlockly adds block coding if devices available
