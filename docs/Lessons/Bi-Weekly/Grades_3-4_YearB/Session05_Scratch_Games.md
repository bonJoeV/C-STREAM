## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Why Games?**
   - Games bring joy and connection
   - Exercise minds and teach skills
   - Combine art, logic, and creativity
2. **Game Elements:**
   - **Input** — How players control (keys, mouse)
   - **Feedback** — What players see/hear
   - **Goals** — What players try to achieve
   - **Score** — How progress is measured
3. **Creativity as Gift** — "God creates—so can we!"

### Main Activity: Game Creation (27 minutes)

**Part 1: Game Mechanics Demo (5 minutes)**

- Demo simple game:
  - Sprite moves with arrow keys
  - Catches/avoids other sprites
  - Score increases

- Show key blocks:
  - "when [key] pressed"
  - "change x by 10"
  - "if touching [sprite]"
  - "change [score] by 1"

**Part 2: Build Your Game (18 minutes)**

**Choose Game Type (2 min):**

- Maze navigator

- Catching game

- Avoid obstacles

- Chase game

**Build Step-by-Step (16 min):**

1. **Player Controls (4 min)**
   - Add sprite for player
   - Program arrow key movement:
     - Up: change y by 10
     - Down: change y by -10
     - Left: change x by -10
     - Right: change x by 10

2. **Game Elements (4 min)**
   - Add sprite to catch/avoid
   - Make it move (glide randomly or bounce)
   - Or create walls/obstacles

3. **Scoring (4 min)**
   - Create variable called "Score"
   - When touching target: change Score by 1
   - Display score on stage

4. **Polish (4 min)**
   - Add sounds for events
   - Add instructions
   - Test and debug!

**Part 3: Playtest (4 minutes)**

- Swap with a partner

- Play each other's games

- Give feedback: What's fun? What's confusing?

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your game screen
2. List the controls in your game
3. Write: "The hardest part was..."
4. Write: "Games bring joy by..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Play Showcase** — Quick demos of games
2. **Joy of Creating** — "How did making this feel?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for creativity and play. Help us use games to bring people together. Amen."*
