# Session 10: Geology Rocks 🪨

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 10 of 17

Students explore geology, identifying rock types and understanding how Earth's processes shaped our world.

---

# Session 10: Geology Rocks

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Identify the three types of rocks

- Understand how each rock type forms

- Examine and classify rock samples

- Connect geology to God's creative work

---

# Session 10: Geology Rocks

## Materials Needed

- 🪨 Rock samples (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic)

- 🔍 Magnifying glasses

- 📋 Rock classification charts

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📸 Rock cycle diagrams

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Jesus as the Rock** — Jesus used the image of rock as a foundation: "On this rock I will build my church."

### Scripture
> *"The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer."* — Psalm 18:2

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created the solid earth beneath our feet. Thank you for rocks that form the foundation of our world. Help us learn about your ancient creation today. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Rocks Are Everywhere:**
   - Mountains, beaches, soil—all rocks!
   - Buildings, roads, monuments—from rocks!
2. **Three Rock Types:**
   - 🔥 **Igneous** — From cooled lava/magma (fire-born!)
   - 🏔️ **Sedimentary** — Layers pressed together over time
   - 💎 **Metamorphic** — Changed by heat and pressure
3. **Rock Cycle:**
   - Rocks constantly change from one type to another
   - Takes millions of years!
4. **Jesus the Rock:**
   - Foundation—strong, reliable
   - "On this rock I will build my church"

### Main Activity: Rock Exploration (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Rock Cycle Learning (6 minutes)**

- Trace the rock cycle:
  1. Magma cools → Igneous rock
  2. Weather breaks it down → Sediment
  3. Layers press together → Sedimentary rock
  4. Heat and pressure → Metamorphic rock
  5. Melts → Back to magma

- "This cycle has been going for billions of years!"

**Part 2: Rock Identification Lab (12 minutes)**

**Examine Rock Samples:**
Use magnifying glasses to observe:

**Igneous Rocks (granite, obsidian, pumice):**

- Look for crystals

- Pumice floats (gas bubbles)!

- Obsidian is glassy

**Sedimentary Rocks (sandstone, limestone, shale):**

- Look for layers

- May see fossils!

- Often grainy texture

**Metamorphic Rocks (marble, slate, quartzite):**

- Look for bands/stripes

- Often very hard

- Changed from other rocks

**Classification Practice:**

- Sort unknown samples

- Use classification chart

- Record observations

**Part 3: Rock Uses Discussion (6 minutes)**

- How do we use each type?
  - Granite: Countertops, monuments
  - Limestone: Buildings, cement
  - Marble: Statues, floors

- Local rocks: What's in Minnesota?

**Part 4: Wrap-Up (2 minutes)**

- Review three types

- "Rocks tell Earth's story!"

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw and label the rock cycle
2. Draw one rock of each type
3. Write: "I can identify rocks by looking for..."
4. Write: "Jesus as 'the rock' means..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Favorite Discovery** — "What surprised you about rocks?"
2. **Ancient Creation** — "Rocks remind us of God's ancient work!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, you are our rock and foundation. Thank you for creating Earth's solid foundation. Help us build our lives on you. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Named three rock types

- [ ] Explained rock formation

- [ ] Classified rock samples

- [ ] Connected to faith theme

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on one rock type

- Pre-labeled samples for matching

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Research specific rock types

- Create rock collection guide

- Study local geology

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Go rock hunting in your yard or on a walk! Try to identify rock types. Research Minnesota geology. Visit a natural history museum. Start a rock collection!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Rock samples available from science supply or local collection

- Consider rock exchange with students

- Connect to Minnesota geology (Lake Superior agates!)

- Great for outdoor education connections
