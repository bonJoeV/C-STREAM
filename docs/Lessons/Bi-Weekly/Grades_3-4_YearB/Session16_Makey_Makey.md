## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **What is Makey Makey?**
   - "Turns ANYTHING into a keyboard or controller!"
   - If it conducts electricity even a little, it works
   - Fruit, foil, play-doh, water, people!
2. **How It Works:**
   - Conductivity = electricity can flow through
   - You complete the circuit by touching
   - Computer thinks you pressed a key!
3. **Endless Possibilities:**
   - Piano made from bananas
   - Video game controller from play-doh
   - Interactive poster
4. **Creative Gift** — "God made us creative like Him!"

### Main Activity: Makey Makey Invention (27 minutes)

**Part 1: Basic Setup (5 minutes)**

- Connect Makey Makey to computer

- Open Scratch or online piano

- Test with simple touch:
  - Clip to conductive object
  - Hold ground wire
  - Touch object—it works!

- "YOU complete the circuit!"

**Part 2: Guided Inventions (10 minutes)**

**Banana Piano:**

- Connect each clip to different banana

- Hold ground

- Each banana = different note!

- Play a song!

**Play-Doh Controller:**

- Make shapes from play-doh

- Connect clips to different shapes

- Use in Scratch game

- Control character with play-doh!

**Part 3: Creative Invention Challenge (10 minutes)**

**Challenge:** Create YOUR OWN Makey Makey invention!

**Ideas:**

- Interactive story (touch to advance)

- Musical instrument from objects

- Quiz game with physical answers

- Art installation

- Controller for Scratch game

**Process:**
1. Plan invention (2 min)
2. Set up materials and clips (4 min)
3. Connect to computer program (2 min)
4. Test and refine (2 min)

**Part 4: Invention Showcase (2 minutes)**

- Share inventions

- Try each other's creations!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your Makey Makey invention
2. Write: "Makey Makey works because..."
3. Write: "My invention does..."
4. Write: "I could use this to help others by..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Creativity Celebration** — "What amazing invention did you see?"
2. **Infinite Possibilities** — "What else could you create?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for the joy of inventing! Help us use creativity to bring joy and serve others. Amen."*
