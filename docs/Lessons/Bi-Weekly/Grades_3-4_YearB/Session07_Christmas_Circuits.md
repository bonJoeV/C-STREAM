# Session 7: Christmas Circuits

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Build working LED circuits

- Understand series and parallel circuits

- Create Christmas-themed light project

- Connect the symbolism of light to Jesus' birth

---

# Session 7: Christmas Circuits

## Materials Needed

- 🔋 Coin cell batteries

- 💡 LEDs (yellow, warm colors)

- 📏 Copper tape

- 📦 Cardstock/cardboard for scenes

- 📓 Engineering journals

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**The Holy Family** — Jesus, Mary, and Joseph in the Nativity remind us that God became one of us!

### Scripture
> *"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."* — John 1:5

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, you came as light into our dark world. As we create lights to celebrate your birth, fill our hearts with Christmas joy. Come, Lord Jesus! Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Advent & Christmas:**
   - Preparing for Jesus' birth
   - Light symbolism: Jesus is the Light!
   - Star led wise men to Jesus
2. **Circuit Review:**
   - Complete path for electricity
   - Power source → conductor → output → back to power
3. **Today's Project:**
   - Create lit Nativity or Christmas scene!

### Main Activity: Christmas Circuit Creation (27 minutes)

**Part 1: Circuit Basics (5 minutes)**

- Review from Session 7 Year A (or teach new):

- LED has two legs:
  - Long leg = positive (+)
  - Short leg = negative (-)

- Must connect correctly to light up!

- Demo simple circuit with battery and LED

**Part 2: Design Christmas Scene (5 minutes)**

- Choose design:
  - Nativity scene with star
  - Christmas tree with lights
  - Advent wreath
  - Angel with glowing halo

- Sketch where lights will go

- Plan circuit path

**Part 3: Build Circuit Scene (15 minutes)**

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Create scene base** (cardstock/cardboard)
2. **Mark LED positions** (poke small holes)
3. **Lay copper tape paths:**
   - One path from battery + to LED long legs
   - One path from LED short legs to battery -
4. **Insert LEDs** through holes
5. **Connect battery** with tape
6. **Add switch** if desired (paper fold)
7. **Decorate scene** around lights!

**Part 4: Light Up (2 minutes)**

- Test your circuit

- Debug if needed

- Celebrate the light!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your circuit diagram (label +/-)
2. Sketch your Christmas scene
3. Write: "Light reminds us of Jesus because..."
4. Write: "My circuit worked/didn't work because..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Christmas Light Show** — All circuits light up together!
2. **Jesus the Light** — "How does Jesus bring light to the world?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Jesus, Light of the World, shine in our hearts this Christmas. May we share your light with everyone! Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Built working circuit

- [ ] Understood LED polarity

- [ ] Created meaningful Christmas scene

- [ ] Connected light to faith theme

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-made circuit template

- Simple single-LED design

- Partner assistance

### For Advanced Students

- Multiple LEDs (series or parallel)

- Blinking effect (add resistor)

- Complex scene design

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Give your light scene as a Christmas gift! Look at Christmas lights—how do they work? Discuss Jesus as the Light of the World. Create more light projects as gifts!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Test all batteries before class

- Have extra supplies for troubleshooting

- Great gifts for families

- Display at Christmas concert/event
