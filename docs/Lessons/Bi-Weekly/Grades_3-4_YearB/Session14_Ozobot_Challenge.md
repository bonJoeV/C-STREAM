## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Thomas Aquinas** — Used rigorous logic to explore complex questions. Programming requires similar logical thinking!

### Scripture
> *"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."* — Galatians 6:9

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for growth and learning. Help us persevere through challenges today. When things are difficult, give us patience and creativity. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Growth Journey:**
   - "Remember Session 2? You're so much better now!"
   - Show early vs. recent work
2. **Today's Challenge:**
   - Complex missions
   - Problem-solving required
3. **Perseverance:**
   - "Keep going when it's hard!"
   - Debugging is part of the process

### Main Activity: Challenge Course (27 minutes)

**Part 1: Quick Review (3 minutes)**

- Review key color codes

- Connect Ozobots

- Test basic movements

**Part 2: Challenge Missions (20 minutes)**

**Mission 1: Maze Master (4 min)**

- Navigate complex maze

- Multiple decision points

- Use color codes for special moves

- Time trial option

**Mission 2: Multi-Code Sequence (4 min)**

- Create course with 4+ color codes

- Each must work correctly

- Test precision!

**Mission 3: OzoBlockly Challenge (if devices available) (6 min)**

- Program Ozobot using blocks

- Create dance or light show

- Load program to robot

- Share performance!

**Mission 4: Design Your Own Challenge (4 min)**

- Create challenge for a classmate

- Include at least 3 codes

- Tricky but solvable!

- Exchange and try!

**Mission 5: Speed Challenge (2 min)**

- Race against others (or clock)

- Accuracy + speed

- Celebrate winners!

**Part 3: Reflection & Share (4 minutes)**

- What was hardest?

- What did you learn?

- How have you grown?

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your most challenging course
2. Write: "I've improved since Session 2 by..."
3. Write: "When my code didn't work, I..."
4. Rate your Ozobot skills: Beginner → Expert

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Growth Celebration** — Acknowledge improvement!
2. **Perseverance Lesson** — "What helps you keep going?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for helping us grow. May we always persevere in learning and in faith. Amen."*
