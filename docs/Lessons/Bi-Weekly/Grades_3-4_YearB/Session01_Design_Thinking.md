## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Isidore of Seville** — Patron saint of the internet! He organized knowledge to help others learn.

### Scripture
> *"So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you."* — Matthew 7:12

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, help us see the world through others' eyes. Give us compassion to understand what people need and creativity to design solutions that truly help. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Design Thinking:**
   - "Starts with understanding PEOPLE, not just problems"
   - Used by top companies like Apple, Google, IDEO
2. **The Five Steps:**
   - 💗 **EMPATHIZE** — Understand the user
   - 🎯 **DEFINE** — State the problem clearly
   - 💡 **IDEATE** — Brainstorm many solutions
   - 🔧 **PROTOTYPE** — Build quick models
   - 🧪 **TEST** — Get feedback, improve
3. **St. Isidore** — Organized information to help people learn
4. **Golden Rule** — Design for others as you'd want!

### Main Activity: Design Challenge (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Empathize & Define (8 minutes)**

**Challenge:** Design something to help a classmate!

**Interview Your Partner (4 min):**

- What's something difficult in your day?

- What frustrates you at school?

- What would make your life easier?

- What do you wish you had?

**Define the Problem (4 min):**

- Write a problem statement:

- "[Name] needs a way to [do something] because [reason]"

- Example: "Maria needs a way to keep her desk organized because she loses her pencils"

**Part 2: Ideate (5 minutes)**

- Sketch 3+ different solution ideas

- Wild ideas welcome!

- Don't judge yet—just generate!

- Share ideas with partner

**Part 3: Prototype (10 minutes)**

- Choose your best idea

- Build a quick model using available materials

- Doesn't need to be perfect—just enough to show the idea

- Label important features

**Part 4: Test & Feedback (3 minutes)**

- Show prototype to your partner

- Get feedback:
  - What works?
  - What could be better?
  - Does it solve their problem?

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Write your partner's problem statement
2. Sketch your solution idea
3. Write: "Design thinking starts with..."
4. Write: "The feedback I received was..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Empathy Reflection** — "What did you learn about your partner?"
2. **Serving Others** — "How does understanding people help us serve?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for helping us see others' needs. May we always design with love. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Conducted empathetic interview

- [ ] Created clear problem statement

- [ ] Generated multiple ideas

- [ ] Built testable prototype

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Provided problem to solve

- Partner support

- Simplified prototype

### For Advanced Students

- More detailed prototype

- Multiple iterations

- User testing documentation

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Use design thinking at home! Interview a family member about a problem. Brainstorm solutions together. Build a prototype from household materials. Test and improve!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Post design thinking process in classroom

- This framework is used throughout the year

- Encourage genuine empathy in interviews

- Prototypes should be rough—that's the point!
