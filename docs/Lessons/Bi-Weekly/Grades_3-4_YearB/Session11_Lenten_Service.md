### Saint Connection
**Corporal Works of Mercy** — Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, visit the sick, visit prisoners, bury the dead, give alms to the poor.

### Scripture
> *"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."* — Matthew 25:40

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, during Lent we prepare for Easter by growing closer to you. Help us serve others as you served us. Guide our designs to truly help those in need. Amen.*

### Main Activity: Service Design Sprint (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Identify Needs (6 minutes)**

**Community Scan:**

- Who needs help around us?
  - 🏠 Elderly neighbors

  - 😔 Lonely or isolated
  - 🍽️ Food insecure families
  - 🌍 Environmental needs
  - 🎒 Students in need

**Select Focus:**

- Which need can our class address?

- Who can we partner with?

**Part 2: Empathize & Define (5 minutes)**

- Put yourself in their shoes:
  - What does it feel like to have this need?
  - What would REALLY help?
  - What do they actually want (not just what we assume)?

- Write problem statement:
  - "[Group] needs [solution] because [reason]"

**Part 3: Ideate Solutions (5 minutes)**

- Brainstorm many ideas

- Don't judge—generate!

- Wild ideas welcome

- Build on others' ideas

- Vote on best idea(s)

**Part 4: Plan & Prototype (8 minutes)**

**For Chosen Project:**

- What exactly will we do?

- When will we do it?

- What materials/resources do we need?

- Who needs to help?

- Create timeline

**Prototype:**

- Build/create sample if physical project

- Write plan if service action

- Prepare presentation for approval

**Part 5: Commitment (2 minutes)**

- Class commitment to action

- Individual roles

- Schedule follow-up

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Describe the need you identified
2. Sketch/write your solution
3. Write: "My role in this project is..."
4. Write: "I will sacrifice _____ during Lent for others"

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
