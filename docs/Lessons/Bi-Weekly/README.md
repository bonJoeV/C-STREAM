# 📅 Bi-Weekly C-STREAM Curriculum

**17 Sessions for Every-Other-Week Scheduling**

This folder contains condensed C-STREAM curricula for schools that have STREAM class **every other week** instead of weekly. Each bi-weekly curriculum covers the same essential skills, concepts, and faith integration as the weekly version, but condensed into 17 sessions.

### Long-Arc Projects
Major engineering challenges that span 5-8 weeks in weekly curriculum:

- Condensed to **2-3 sessions** with streamlined scope

- Focus on essential design-build-test-reflect cycles

- Some optional extensions available for enrichment

### Faith Integration
All Catholic identity elements preserved:

- Saint connections
