# Session 10: Magnets & Motion 🧲

## Overview
**Grades:** 1-2 | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Session:** 10 of 17

Students explore the invisible force of magnetism, discovering how magnets push, pull, and make things move.

---

# Session 10: Magnets & Motion

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand that magnets attract some materials

- Explore magnetic push and pull forces

- Test objects for magnetic properties

- Connect invisible forces to God's design

---

# Session 10: Magnets & Motion

## Materials Needed

- 📦 Magnets (bar and disc magnets)

- 📦 Test objects (paperclips, coins, plastic, wood, foil, fabric)

- 📋 Predict & Test chart

- 📓 Design Detective journals

- 🧭 Compass (optional demonstration)

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Hildegard of Bingen** — She studied the natural world, including stones and their properties. She'd be fascinated by magnets!

### Scripture
> *"He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing."* — Job 26:7

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you made invisible forces like magnetism that hold our world together. Thank you for the amazing things we can't see but know are real. Help us discover more about your creation today. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Magic or Science?** — Show magnets sticking together (looks like magic!)
2. **Invisible Forces** — "Magnets have INVISIBLE pulling power!"
3. **Attract & Repel:**
   - Magnets ATTRACT (pull toward) some things
   - Magnets can also REPEL (push away) other magnets
4. **God's Invisible Design** — "Many things in God's world are invisible but real—like love, air, and magnetic force!"

### Main Activity: Magnet Exploration (19 minutes)

**Part 1: Attract or Not? (7 minutes)**

- Predict & Test activity

- For each object:
  - PREDICT: Will the magnet attract it? (yes/no)
  - TEST: Try it!
  - RECORD: What happened?

- Test: paperclips, coins, plastic, wood, foil, pencil, fabric

- Discovery: "What kinds of things are magnets attracted to?" (Metal things, especially iron/steel)

**Part 2: Push and Pull (6 minutes)**

- Use two magnets

- Try to stick them together different ways

- Sometimes they attract (pull together)

- Sometimes they repel (push apart)

- "Magnets have two poles—north and south!"

- Demo: Make magnets "chase" each other

**Part 3: Magnet Challenge (6 minutes)**

- Challenge: Use magnets to move paperclips WITHOUT touching them!

- Try through paper, cardboard, or thin plastic

- "Magnetic force goes through things!"

- Creative exploration time

### Design Detective Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw objects that were magnetic vs. not magnetic
2. Write: "Magnets attract..."
3. Write: "Something invisible but real is..."

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Magnet Discovery** — "What did you learn about magnets?"
2. **Invisible Things** — "What else is invisible but real?" (God's love, air, gravity)
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for invisible forces that make our world work. Thank you for your invisible love that's always with us. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Predicted and tested magnetic properties

- [ ] Observed attract/repel behaviors

- [ ] Made connection to invisible forces

- [ ] Recorded discoveries

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Fewer test items

- Focus on attract only

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Explore magnetic field patterns (iron filings if available)

- Test more materials

- Research how magnets are used in everyday life

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Go on a magnet hunt at home (use a refrigerator magnet)! What sticks? What doesn't? Test different metals—are they all magnetic? Where are magnets used in your home? (Refrigerator, cabinet doors, speakers)

---

## Teacher Notes

- Magnet kits available from CSCOE

- Small magnets can be swallowed—supervise carefully

- Iron filings are messy but show field lines beautifully

- Connect to Earth's magnetic field and compasses
