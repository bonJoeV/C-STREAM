## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Paul** — He was completely transformed on the road to Damascus, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly!

### Scripture
> *"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"* — 2 Corinthians 5:17

*Dear God, you designed the amazing butterfly transformation. Thank you for making all things new! Help us be transformed by your love. Amen.*

  4. **Butterfly** — Emerges with wings!

- "The caterpillar doesn't just get wings—it completely changes!"

- Time frame: 3-4 weeks for most butterflies

**Part 2: Life Cycle Model (10 minutes)**

- Create paper plate life cycle:
  - Divide plate into 4 sections
  - Add each stage:
    - Draw or glue small shape for egg
    - Pasta spiral or drawing for caterpillar
    - Pasta shell or folded paper for chrysalis
    - Drawn or cut-out butterfly
  - Add arrows showing cycle direction
  - Label each stage

**Part 3: Transformation Connection (3 minutes)**

- Discussion: "How can WE be transformed?"
  - Learning new things (growing smarter)
  - Becoming kinder
  - Growing closer to God
