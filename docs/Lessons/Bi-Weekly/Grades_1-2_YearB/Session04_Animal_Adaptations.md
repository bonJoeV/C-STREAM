## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — He loved all animals and called them his "brothers and sisters," seeing God's care in every creature.

### Scripture
> *"Ask the animals, and they will teach you."* — Job 12:7

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you made every animal with special gifts to help it survive. Thank you for your wisdom in creation. Help us learn from the animals today. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Animal Wonder** — "Why do polar bears have white fur?"
2. **Adaptations** — "God designed animals with special features!"
3. **Examples:**
   - 🦅 Eagle: Sharp eyes to see food
   - 🐪 Camel: Humps to store water
   - 🐻‍❄️ Polar bear: White fur to hide in snow
   - 🐟 Fish: Gills to breathe underwater
4. **St. Francis** — "He knew animals teach us about God!"

### Main Activity: Adaptation Exploration (18 minutes)

**Part 1: Adaptation Gallery (5 minutes)**

- Show animal pictures with adaptations

- For each animal:
  - What special feature do you see?
  - How does it help the animal?
  - Where does this animal live?

- Students make observations

**Part 2: Match the Adaptation (4 minutes)**

- Activity: Match animals to their habitats

- Why does each animal fit its home?

- Discuss: "What would happen if a polar bear lived in the desert?"

**Part 3: Design Your Animal (9 minutes)**

- Choose a habitat (desert, arctic, ocean, forest)

- Design an animal that could live there

- What adaptations does it need?
  - Desert: Big ears (cooling), stores water
  - Arctic: Thick fur, white color
  - Ocean: Fins, gills, streamlined
  - Forest: Camouflage, claws for climbing

- Draw and label your animal's features

### Design Detective Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw your designed animal
2. Label its special adaptations
3. Write: "My animal lives in ___ because..."

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Share Designs** — Quick show of created animals
2. **God's Wisdom** — "God knew exactly what each animal needed!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for your amazing animal designs. Help us take care of all your creatures. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified animal adaptations

- [ ] Connected adaptations to survival

- [ ] Designed animal with appropriate features

- [ ] Related design to habitat

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on 2-3 clear examples

- Choose from adaptation options

- Partner work for design

### For Advanced Students

- Design animal for unusual habitat

- Multiple adaptations with explanations

- Research real animals with unique features

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Watch an animal documentary together! Look for adaptations. Visit a zoo and notice what makes each animal special. Design a creature together for a made-up habitat!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Great connection to science curriculum

- Consider showing video clips of animals

- This prepares for habitat building later

- Connect to environmental stewardship
