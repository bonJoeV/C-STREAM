## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Thomas Aquinas** — He loved using logic and reason to solve problems. He'd enjoy programming challenges!

### Scripture
> *"I can do all this through him who gives me strength."* — Philippians 4:13

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for minds that can solve problems. When things get hard, help us keep trying. Give us patience, creativity, and teamwork today. Amen.*
