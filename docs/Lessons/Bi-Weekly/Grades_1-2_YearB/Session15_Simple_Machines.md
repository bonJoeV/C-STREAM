# Session 15: Simple Machines ⚙️

## Overview
**Grades:** 1-2 | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Session:** 15 of 17

Students explore simple machines that make work easier, discovering how levers and ramps help us lift and move things.

---

# Session 15: Simple Machines

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Identify simple machines (lever, ramp/inclined plane)

- Understand that machines make work easier

- Experiment with levers and ramps

- Connect engineering to helping others

---

# Session 15: Simple Machines

## Materials Needed

- 📦 Lever materials (rulers, pencils as fulcrums, small weights)

- 📦 Ramp materials (books, boards, toy cars)

- 📓 Design Detective journals

- 📸 Pictures of simple machines in use

- 📦 Small objects to lift/move

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Joseph the Worker** — As a carpenter, he used simple machines every day to build and create!

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart."* — Colossians 3:23

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for simple machines that help us do hard work. Like St. Joseph, help us use tools wisely to serve others. Bless our learning today. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Heavy Lifting** — "Have you ever had to lift something heavy?"
2. **Machines Help** — "Simple machines make work EASIER!"
3. **Today's Focus:**
   - **Lever** — Like a seesaw! Helps lift things
   - **Ramp/Inclined Plane** — Like a slide! Helps move things up
4. **St. Joseph** — Used these tools as a carpenter
5. **Let's Experiment!**

### Main Activity: Simple Machine Exploration (19 minutes)

**Part 1: Lever Investigation (8 minutes)**

- Build a lever:
  - Ruler balanced on a pencil (fulcrum)
  - Put a small object on one end
  - Push down on the other end

- Experiments:
  - Move the fulcrum—what changes?
  - Closer to object = easier to lift!
  - Where are the best spots?

- Discussion: "Where do we see levers?" (seesaw, door handle, scissors)

**Part 2: Ramp Investigation (8 minutes)**

- Build a ramp:
  - Board or books propped on a stack
  - Roll car or push object up

- Experiments:
  - Steep ramp vs. gentle ramp—which is easier?
  - Test with different objects
  - Measure how far things roll

- Discussion: "Where do we see ramps?" (wheelchair ramps, playground slides, loading docks)

**Part 3: Design Challenge (3 minutes)**

- Quick challenge: Use a lever OR ramp to move a small toy

- Show your solution!

### Design Detective Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw a lever you made
2. Draw a ramp you made
3. Write: "Simple machines make work easier by..."
4. Draw where you see simple machines in the world

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Machine Discovery** — "What did you learn about simple machines?"
2. **Helping Others** — "How do ramps help people?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for simple machines that help us work. Help us always use our knowledge to serve others. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Built and tested lever

- [ ] Built and tested ramp

- [ ] Understood machines make work easier

- [ ] Identified real-world examples

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-built lever and ramp to experiment with

- Focus on one machine type

- Partner exploration

### For Advanced Students

- Experiment with multiple fulcrum positions

- Measure and record data

- Research other simple machines (wheel, pulley)

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Find simple machines at home! Doorknobs, scissors, wheelbarrows, ramps for strollers. Build ramps for toy cars—test steep vs. gentle. Try making a lever to lift a book!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Simple Machines Kit available from CSCOE

- Great connection to playground equipment

- Wheelchair ramps connect to accessibility/dignity discussion

- Can extend to pulleys and wheels in future lessons
