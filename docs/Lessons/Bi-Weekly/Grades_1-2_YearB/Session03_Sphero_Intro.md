## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — A teenager who loved technology and used it to share faith. He created websites about miracles!

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."* — Colossians 3:23

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for technology and the creative people who make it. Help us use technology wisely, like Blessed Carlo Acutis did. Bless our learning today. Amen.*

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Talk about robots at home! Where do we see robots? (Vacuums, factories, space) Play "robot"—give family members exact instructions to follow. How important is being specific?

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve Sphero from CSCOE 2 weeks ahead

- Charge robots fully before session

- Sphero Edu app is free

- Have backup activities if tech issues arise
