# Session 02: Tower Power 🏰

## Overview
**Grades:** 1-2 | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Session:** 2 of 17

Students explore what makes structures stable, designing and building towers that are tall AND strong.

---

# Session 02: Tower Power

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand that wide bases provide stability

- Build towers using various materials

- Test structures for height and strength

- Practice iteration (trying again to improve)

---

# Session 02: Tower Power

## Materials Needed

- 📦 KEVA Planks (from CSCOE library)

- 📦 Cups (paper or plastic)

- 📦 Index cards

- 📏 Measuring stick or tape measure

- 📓 Design Detective journals

- 📸 Pictures of famous towers

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Barbara** — Patron saint of architects and builders. She's remembered for her faith that was strong like a tower!

### Scripture
> *"The name of the Lord is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe."* — Proverbs 18:10

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you are our strong tower! Help us build towers today that are strong and stable. When we face challenges, remind us that you are our strength. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Famous Towers** — Show pictures:
   - Eiffel Tower
   - Leaning Tower of Pisa
   - Church bell towers
2. **What Makes Towers Strong?**
   - Wide base
   - Balanced weight
   - Strong materials
3. **Today's Challenge** — "Build the TALLEST tower that can stand for 10 seconds!"

### Main Activity: Tower Engineering (19 minutes)

**Part 1: Quick Challenge - Cup Towers (6 minutes)**

- Partners receive 10 cups

- Challenge: Build as tall as possible

- Test: Does it stand for 10 seconds?

- Observe: What patterns make towers stable?

**Part 2: KEVA Plank Towers (10 minutes)**

- Switch to KEVA Planks

- Challenge: Build taller than a ruler (12 inches)!

- Design considerations:
  - Start with wide base
  - Build symmetrically
  - Test as you build

- Measure final heights

**Part 3: Improvement Round (3 minutes)**

- "What would make your tower stronger?"

- One more try to improve!

- Compare: Better? What changed?

### Design Detective Journal (4 minutes)
1. Draw your tallest tower
2. Label: Base, middle, top
3. Write: "My tower was ___ inches tall"
4. Write: "Strong towers need..."

### Closing Circle (2 minutes)
1. **Tower Secrets** — "What makes towers stable?"
2. **Faith Connection** — "God is our strong tower!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for being our strong tower. Help us build strong structures and strong faith. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Built towers using multiple materials

- [ ] Identified features of stable structures

- [ ] Measured and compared heights

- [ ] Improved designs through iteration

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on cup stacking only

- Lower height goal (6 inches)

- Build alongside teacher

### For Advanced Students

- Must support a book on top

- Try multiple tower designs

- Record data systematically

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Build towers at home with blocks, cups, cards, or food cans. Have a family tower competition! What made the winning tower special? Visit or look up pictures of the Eiffel Tower.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve KEVA Planks from CSCOE 2 weeks ahead

- Save tower measurement data for comparison

- Take photos of successful designs

- Connect to architecture and construction careers
