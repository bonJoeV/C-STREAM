---

# Session 5: Scratch Games

## Materials Needed

- 💻 Computers with Scratch access

- 📝 Game design documents

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🎮 Game examples

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Recreation and Leisure** — Catholic tradition values healthy recreation! St. John Bosco used games and play to reach young people. Good games can build community and skills!

### Scripture
> *"A cheerful heart is good medicine."* — Proverbs 17:22

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for the gift of play and creativity. Help us design games that bring joy, build skills, and respect the player. May our creativity honor you. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Game Design Philosophy:**
   - Good games are intentionally designed
   - Balance challenge and fun
   - Consider the player experience
2. **Ethics in Gaming:**
   - Games can be positive or harmful
   - Our responsibility as creators
   - Design for good: skill-building, connection, joy
3. **Programming Concepts:**
   - Variables — Track score, lives, progress
   - Conditionals — If-then decisions
   - Loops — Repeated actions
   - Events — Respond to player input

### Main Activity: Game Development (31 minutes)

**Part 1: Game Design Document (7 minutes)**

**Answer These Questions:**
1. **Game Concept:**
   - What type of game? (Maze, catch, quiz, adventure, platform)
   - What's the goal?
   - What makes it fun?

2. **Game Mechanics:**
   - How does the player control?
   - What are the rules?
   - How does the player win/lose?

3. **Player Experience:**
   - Is difficulty balanced?
   - Is it appropriate for all ages?
   - Does it build positive skills?

4. **Technical Plan:**
   - What sprites needed?
   - What variables needed?
   - What events trigger actions?

**Part 2: Programming (20 minutes)**

**Build Your Game:**

**Step 1: Set Up (3 min)**

- Create sprites

- Set up backdrop

- Initialize variables (score, lives)

**Step 2: Player Control (5 min)**

- Arrow key movement

- Click interactions

- Responsive controls

**Step 3: Game Logic (7 min)**

- Scoring system

- Win/lose conditions

- Obstacle/enemy behavior

- Level progression (if time)

**Step 4: Polish (5 min)**

- Sound effects

- Visual feedback

- Instructions

- Game over screen

**Part 3: Playtesting (4 minutes)**

- Test each other's games

- Give constructive feedback:
  - What's fun?
  - What's confusing?
  - What could improve?

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Game concept sketch
2. Variables used: ___
3. Conditionals used: ___
4. Player feedback: ___
5. Write: "Good game design includes..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Showcase** — Brief game demos!
2. **Design Ethics** — "How can games be positive?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for the joy of creativity and play. Help us use these skills to bring happiness to others. Amen."*
