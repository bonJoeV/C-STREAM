# Session 12: Ecosystems 🌿

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 12 of 17

Students investigate ecosystem dynamics and design engineering solutions that support or restore environmental balance.

---

# Session 12: Ecosystems

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand ecosystem interconnections

- Analyze human impacts on ecosystems

- Design solutions that restore balance

- Apply creation care principles

---

# Session 12: Ecosystems

## Materials Needed

- 📊 Ecosystem diagrams

- 📦 Terrarium/model supplies (optional)

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 💻 Research resources

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — Patron saint of ecology! "Canticle of the Sun" celebrates all creation. Pope Francis named his environmental encyclical "Laudato Si'" after St. Francis's canticle.

### Scripture
> *"The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it."* — Psalm 24:1

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created an interconnected world of amazing balance. Help us understand ecosystems and our responsibility to protect them. Make us faithful stewards of your creation. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Ecosystem Wonder:**
   - Everything is connected!
   - Food webs, energy flow, nutrient cycles
   - Remove one part, everything affected
2. **St. Francis & Ecology:**
   - Saw God in all creation
   - "Brother Sun, Sister Moon"
   - Called to care for "our common home"
3. **Human Impact:**
   - We are part of ecosystems
   - Our choices affect everything
   - Engineers can help restore balance

### Main Activity: Ecosystem Engineering (28 minutes)

**Part 1: Ecosystem Investigation (10 minutes)**

**Understand the System:**

**Choose an Ecosystem to Study:**

- Local ecosystem (your area)

- Coral reef

- Rainforest

- Wetland

- Prairie/grassland

- Urban ecosystem

**Map the Connections:**

- Producers (plants/algae)

- Consumers (herbivores, carnivores)

- Decomposers

- Energy flow

- Nutrient cycles

- Water cycle role

**Identify Threats:**

- What is harming this ecosystem?

- Human-caused issues

- Natural challenges

- Cascade effects (one problem leads to others)

**Part 2: Restoration Design (15 minutes)**

**Engineering for Ecosystem Health:**

**Problem Definition (3 min):**

- Specific ecosystem challenge

- Root cause, not just symptom

- "How might we restore/protect [specific issue]?"

**Solution Design (10 min):**

**Categories of Solutions:**

- **Habitat restoration** — Rebuilding damaged areas

- **Species protection** — Helping threatened organisms

- **Pollution reduction** — Cleaning water, air, soil

- **Barrier systems** — Protecting from invasive species

- **Monitoring technology** — Sensors and tracking

- **Education/behavior** — Changing human actions

**Design Your Solution:**

- What exactly will it do?

- How does it address root cause?

- How does it work with nature, not against it?

- What's the expected impact?

- Sketch with explanation

**Part 3: Solution Share (3 minutes)**

- Present ecosystem and solution

- Discuss feasibility

- Connect to local actions

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Ecosystem studied: ___
2. Draw ecosystem web (connections)
3. Problem addressed: ___
4. Solution design sketch and explanation
5. Write: "Caring for ecosystems honors God because..."

### Closing Circle (5 minutes)
1. **St. Francis Prayer** — Read excerpt from Canticle of the Sun
2. **Personal Commitment** — "One thing I'll do for creation care..."
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Creator God, help us be good stewards of ecosystems. Like St. Francis, may we see your beauty in all creation. Guide our hands to protect and restore. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Understood ecosystem connections

- [ ] Identified human impacts

- [ ] Designed viable restoration solution

- [ ] Connected to faith stewardship

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on local/familiar ecosystem

- Simplified mapping

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Complex system analysis

- Research real restoration projects

- Implementation planning

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Explore local ecosystem! Visit a park, stream, or natural area. Identify producers, consumers, decomposers. Research: What threatens ecosystems near you? What restoration projects exist? Read about St. Francis!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Spring timing perfect for outdoor observation

- Connect to Laudato Si' themes

- Local conservation organizations may partner

- Consider terrarium creation as extended project
