## Catholic Integration

### Theme
**Works of Mercy** — Traditional Catholic ways of living mercy in the world, both physical (corporal) and spiritual needs.

### Scripture
> *"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in."* — Matthew 25:35

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, you call us to see your face in those who suffer. During Lent, help us practice mercy in action. Guide our designs to truly serve "the least of these." Amen.*

3. **Engineering for Mercy:**
   - How can design address these needs?
   - Technology serving human dignity
   - Our skills for God's kingdom

### Main Activity: Mercy Project Design (28 minutes)

**Part 1: Mercy Focus Selection (6 minutes)**

**Choose a Work of Mercy to Address:**

- Which work resonates with you?

- Where do you see this need?

- How might engineering help?

**Research the Need:**

- Local examples of this need

- Who specifically is affected?

- What solutions exist?

- What gaps remain?

**Part 2: Solution Design (18 minutes)**

**Design Thinking for Mercy:**

**EMPATHIZE (3 min):**

- Put yourself in the position of someone experiencing this need

- What would truly help?

- What preserves dignity?

**DEFINE (2 min):**

- "How might we [address work of mercy] for [specific group]?"

**IDEATE (4 min):**

- Many possible solutions

- Technology-enabled options

- Low-tech options

- Service design options

**PROTOTYPE (7 min):**

- Choose best solution

- Create detailed design or prototype:
  - Physical invention
  - App/digital solution
  - Service system
  - Awareness campaign

- Document how it works

**PLAN (2 min):**

- How could this be implemented?

- What resources needed?

- Who would help?

**Part 3: Presentation (4 minutes)**

- Share mercy project designs

- Explain work of mercy addressed

- Discuss implementation possibilities

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Work of Mercy chosen: ___
2. Need addressed: ___
3. Solution design (sketch and explain):
4. Write: "Mercy means..."
5. Write: "Engineering serves mercy by..."

### Closing Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Commitment** — "How will you practice mercy this Lent?"
2. **Jesus' Challenge** — "Whatever you did for the least of these..."
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Merciful Jesus, you showed perfect mercy. Help us practice mercy in action. Bless our designs and those they will serve. Amen."*
