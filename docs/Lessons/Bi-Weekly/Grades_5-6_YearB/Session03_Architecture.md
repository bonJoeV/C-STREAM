# Session 3: Architecture Engineering 🏛️

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 3 of 17

Students explore architectural engineering principles, designing and building model structures that serve human needs.

---

# Session 3: Architecture Engineering

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand architectural engineering principles

- Design buildings for specific purposes

- Apply structural concepts to architecture

- Balance aesthetics and function

---

# Session 3: Architecture Engineering

## Materials Needed

- 🧱 KEVA Planks (from CSCOE library)

- 📐 Grid paper for blueprints

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📸 Architecture examples

- 📏 Measuring tools

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Medieval Cathedral Architects** — Anonymous builders spent lifetimes constructing churches they'd never see completed. Their buildings still inspire awe 800 years later!

### Scripture
> *"Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain."* — Psalm 127:1

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you are the master architect of creation. Help us design buildings that serve people well and bring beauty to the world. May our work honor you. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Architecture = Art + Engineering:**
   - Buildings must be beautiful AND functional
   - Serve human needs
   - Last for generations
2. **Cathedral Builders:**
   - Built for God's glory
   - Flying buttresses = engineering innovation
   - Light, height, beauty for worship
3. **Architecture Principles:**
   - **Form follows function** — Shape serves purpose
   - **Load distribution** — How weight transfers
   - **Space design** — How people move through

### Main Activity: Architectural Design Challenge (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Blueprint Phase (8 minutes)**

**Design Brief:**
Create a building for ONE purpose:

- School classroom of the future

- Community center

- Church or chapel

- Hospital/clinic

- Library/learning space

**Requirements:**

- Must serve the intended users

- Entrance and exit visible

- Multiple functional areas

- Structural stability

**Blueprint:**

- Draw floor plan (top view)

- Draw front elevation (side view)

- Label key features

- Note structural solutions

**Part 2: Construction Phase (17 minutes)**

**Build with KEVA Planks:**

**Structural Considerations:**

- Foundation stability

- Wall strength

- Roof support

- Opening reinforcement (doors/windows)

**Architectural Features:**

- Different areas for different functions

- Aesthetic elements

- Human-scale proportions

**Tips:**

- Start with strong foundation

- Interlock corners for stability

- Plan roof support before building too high

- Add details that serve function

**Part 3: Architecture Review (5 minutes)**

- Present designs

- Explain purpose and features

- Discuss structural solutions

- Peer feedback on form and function

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Attach or sketch blueprint
2. Building purpose: ___
3. Key structural features: ___
4. Write: "Good architecture serves people by..."
5. Write: "My design honors God because..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Appreciation** — "What building design impressed you?"
2. **Cathedral Connection** — "How did faith inspire great architecture?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Lord, bless the buildings where we live, learn, and worship. Help us create spaces that serve your people well. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Created functional blueprint

- [ ] Built stable structure

- [ ] Balanced form and function

- [ ] Explained design choices

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Simpler building type

- Partner construction

- Template blueprints

### For Advanced Students

- Multiple-story building

- Complex roof design

- Include scale considerations

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Architecture tour! Notice buildings in your community. Which are well-designed? Visit a church and observe architectural features. Research famous architects or cathedrals. Draw your dream building!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve KEVA planks from CSCOE

- Show architecture examples before activity

- Notre Dame, Sagrada Familia are great examples

- Discuss local church architecture
