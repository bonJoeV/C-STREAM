# Session 4: Forensic Science 🔍

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 4 of 17

Students learn forensic science techniques, applying scientific method to solve a classroom mystery through evidence analysis.

---

# Session 4: Forensic Science

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Apply scientific method to investigation

- Analyze multiple types of evidence

- Draw conclusions from evidence

- Understand the importance of truth in justice

---

# Session 4: Forensic Science

## Materials Needed

- 🔬 Magnifying glasses

- 🧪 Evidence samples (prepared ahead)

- 📝 Investigation logs

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📸 Fingerprint materials (optional)

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Thomas More** — "I am the King's good servant, but God's first." He stood for truth even when it cost his life. Justice requires truth!

### Scripture
> *"You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."* — John 8:32

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you are the source of all truth. Help us seek truth carefully and honestly. May our investigations serve justice and honor your command to love truth. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Forensic Science:**
   - Using science to find truth
   - Evidence tells a story
   - Careful observation matters
2. **Truth and Justice:**
   - Catholic teaching: Truth is essential for justice
   - St. Thomas More died for truth
   - Scientists must be honest investigators
3. **Scientific Method in Action:**
   - Observe → Question → Hypothesize → Test → Conclude
   - Evidence-based conclusions
   - Admit what you don't know

### Main Activity: Mystery Investigation (31 minutes)

**Part 1: The Mystery Setup (3 minutes)**

**Teacher-Prepared Mystery:**
"Something happened in our classroom!" (Examples:)

- Missing classroom item

- Mysterious message appeared

- Unknown substance found

- Classroom was "rearranged"

Multiple suspects (fictional characters or teacher personas)
Each has alibis and potential motives

**Part 2: Evidence Station Rotation (20 minutes)**

**Station A: Document Analysis (5 min)**

- Examine handwriting samples

- Compare to mystery note

- Look for distinctive features

- Record observations

**Station B: Substance Analysis (5 min)**

- Unknown powder/substance (safe materials)

- Perform simple tests:
  - Color observation
  - Texture analysis
  - Water reaction
  - Compare to knowns

- Record findings

**Station C: Observation Evidence (5 min)**

- Examine scene photos or recreation

- Look for details:
  - What's out of place?
  - What clues are visible?
  - What patterns exist?

- Record observations

**Station D: Interview Analysis (5 min)**

- Read witness statements

- Look for:
  - Contradictions
  - Missing information
  - Suspicious details

- Record analysis

**Part 3: Team Analysis (5 minutes)**

- Teams compile evidence

- Discuss findings

- Form hypothesis about what happened

- Identify gaps in knowledge

**Part 4: Case Presentation (3 minutes)**

- Present conclusions

- Cite specific evidence

- Acknowledge uncertainties

- Reveal solution!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Evidence summary from each station
2. Your hypothesis: ___
3. Evidence that supports it: ___
4. Evidence that doesn't fit: ___
5. Write: "Truth in science matters because..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Process Reflection** — "What was hardest about investigating?"
2. **Truth Connection** — "Why is honest investigation important?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God of truth, help us always seek what is true and honest. Guide us to use our minds for justice. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Careful observation at stations

- [ ] Evidence-based reasoning

- [ ] Appropriate conclusions

- [ ] Understood truth's importance

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Simplified evidence

- Partner work

- Guided observation sheets

### For Advanced Students

- Additional complexity in evidence

- Lead team analysis

- Design own mystery for peers

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Family mystery night! Create a simple mystery to solve together. Watch forensic science shows critically (what's real vs. TV drama?). Discuss: Why is truth important for justice?

---

## Teacher Notes

- Prepare mystery and evidence beforehand

- Ensure all evidence is age-appropriate

- Solution should be fair and discoverable

- Connect to real forensic science careers
