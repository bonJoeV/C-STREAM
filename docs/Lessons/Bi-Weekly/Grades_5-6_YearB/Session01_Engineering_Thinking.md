## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Teresa of Calcutta** — She saw needs others missed and designed solutions with love. "If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one."

### Scripture
> *"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace."* — 1 Peter 4:10

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you gave us creative minds to solve problems and serve others. Help us see needs with compassionate eyes and design solutions with loving hearts. Guide our thinking this year. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Welcome to Year B!**
   - New year, new challenges, new growth!
   - Building on past learning
2. **Design Thinking Introduction:**
   - Used by world's best innovators
   - Human-centered approach
   - Not just problem-solving—problem FINDING first!
3. **The Five Stages:**
   - **Empathize** — Understand people's needs
   - **Define** — Frame the real problem
   - **Ideate** — Generate many ideas
   - **Prototype** — Build to learn
   - **Test** — Get feedback, improve

### Main Activity: Design Thinking Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Empathize Practice (7 minutes)**

- Pair interview activity:
  - "Tell me about a frustration in your school day"
  - "How does that make you feel?"
  - "What have you tried?"
  - "What would be ideal?"

- LISTEN deeply, don't solve yet!

- Take notes on partner's experience

**Part 2: Define Practice (5 minutes)**

- Analyze interview findings

- Write a "Point of View" statement:
  - "[Name] needs [need] because [insight]"

- Turn into "How Might We" question:
  - "How might we help [name] to [need]?"

**Part 3: Ideate Practice (7 minutes)**

- Rules for ideation:
  - Defer judgment
  - Go for quantity
  - Build on others' ideas
  - Encourage wild ideas!

- Rapid brainstorm: Generate 20+ ideas in 5 minutes!

- Star top 3 concepts

**Part 4: Quick Prototype (8 minutes)**

- Choose one idea

- Build with available materials

- Low-fidelity is fine—build to LEARN

- Focus on concept, not perfection

**Part 5: Test & Feedback (3 minutes)**

- Share prototype with partner

- Get honest feedback

- What works? What's confusing?

- Note improvements

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
**Year B Journal Setup:**
1. Design name page
2. Write: "A design thinker..."
3. Draw the 5 stages with your own icons
4. Reflection: "My strength is ___, I want to grow in ___"

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Insights** — "What surprised you about design thinking?"
2. **Year Preview** — "This method will guide all our work!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for minds that can create. Help us design with empathy and love. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Practiced empathetic listening

- [ ] Created clear problem statement

- [ ] Generated multiple ideas

- [ ] Built and tested prototype

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Guided interview questions

- Partner for all activities

- Simplified prototype focus

### For Advanced Students

- Multiple prototype iterations

- Deeper empathy research

- Lead team activities

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Practice design thinking at home! Interview a family member about a daily frustration. Brainstorm solutions together. Build a quick prototype. Design thinking works everywhere!

---

## Teacher Notes

- This establishes Year B methodology

- Journal setup is important for year

- Emphasize empathy as foundation

- Return to these stages all year
