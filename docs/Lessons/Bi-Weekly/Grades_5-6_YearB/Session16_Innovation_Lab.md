## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Innovation for Good** — Every saint innovated in their own way—new ways to serve, teach, or help! Our inventions should serve the common good.

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."* — Colossians 3:23

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you gave us creative minds to invent and innovate. Help us use all we've learned to create something that truly helps others. May our work honor you. Amen.*

### Main Activity: Innovation Lab (31 minutes)

**Part 1: Problem Discovery (5 minutes)**

**Find a Problem Worth Solving:**

- Observe: What frustrates people around you?

- Listen: What do people complain about?

- Research: What needs exist?

**Good Problems:**

- Affect real people

- Haven't been perfectly solved

- Match your skills/resources

- You care about solving

**Choose Your Focus:**

- Write problem statement

- Who is affected?

- Why does it matter?

**Part 2: Invention Development (22 minutes)**

**Full Design Thinking Cycle:**

**1. EMPATHIZE (3 min):**

- Deep understanding of people with this problem

- What's their experience?

- What have they tried?

- What would help most?

**2. DEFINE (2 min):**

- Clear problem statement

- "How might we [solve problem] for [users]?"

**3. IDEATE (4 min):**

- Generate many solutions

- Wild ideas welcome!

- Build on possibilities

- Select promising approach

**4. PROTOTYPE (10 min):**

- Build your invention!

- Options:
  - Physical prototype
  - App/digital solution
  - Combined approach
  - System/service design

- Focus on demonstrating the concept

**5. TEST (3 min):**

- Does it work?

- Get quick feedback

- Note improvements

**Part 3: Pitch Preparation (4 minutes)**

- Prepare 2-minute pitch:
  - Problem you're solving
  - Who benefits
  - Your solution
  - How it works
  - Why it matters

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Invention name: ___
