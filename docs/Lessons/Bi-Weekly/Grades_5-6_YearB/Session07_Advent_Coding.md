### Saint Connection
**The Prophets** — Isaiah, Micah, and others foretold Christ's coming. Advent is about joyful waiting and preparing for the Light of the World!

### Scripture
> *"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light."* — Isaiah 9:2

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, during Advent we prepare our hearts for Jesus. Help us use our coding skills to share the hope and joy of Christmas. May our projects point others to the Light of the World. Amen.*
