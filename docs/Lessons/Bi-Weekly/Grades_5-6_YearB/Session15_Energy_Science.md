## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Leonardo da Vinci** — Catholic artist and inventor who saw no conflict between faith and science! Designed amazing machines centuries ahead of his time.

### Scripture
> *"I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it."* — Ecclesiastes 3:14 (Energy conservation!)

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created a universe of amazing order where energy transforms but is never lost. Help us understand these principles and use them to engineer solutions. Your design is perfect! Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (8 minutes)
1. **Energy Fundamentals:**
   - Energy cannot be created or destroyed—only transformed!
   - Types of energy:
     - **Kinetic** — Energy of motion
     - **Potential** — Stored energy (height, elastic, chemical)
     - **Thermal** — Heat energy
     - **Electrical** — Moving electrons
     - **Sound** — Vibration energy
     - **Light** — Radiant energy
2. **Simple Machines:**
   - Tools that make work easier
   - Six types:
     - **Lever** — Lifts/moves with fulcrum
     - **Wheel & Axle** — Rotates to reduce friction
     - **Pulley** — Changes direction of force
     - **Inclined Plane** — Ramp reduces force needed
     - **Wedge** — Splits or separates
     - **Screw** — Inclined plane wrapped around cylinder
3. **Conservation:**
   - God's design: Energy conserved
   - Nothing is lost, only transformed
   - "Nothing can be added to it and nothing taken"

### Main Activity: Energy Engineering (28 minutes)

**Part 1: Energy Transformation Investigation (10 minutes)**

**Build Energy Chain:**

- Create system showing energy transformations:
  - Start: Potential energy (height)
  - Transform to: Kinetic energy (motion)
  - Transform to: Kinetic (hit something)
  - Transform to: Sound (noise)
  
**Simple Example: Rube Goldberg Starter**

- Ball on ramp (potential → kinetic)

- Ball hits lever (kinetic → kinetic)

- Lever lifts something (kinetic → potential)

- Continue the chain!

**Part 2: Simple Machine Challenge (15 minutes)**

**Engineering Challenge:**
Design and build a system that:

- Uses at least 2 different simple machines

- Accomplishes a task (lift, move, separate, etc.)

- Shows clear energy transformations

- Is as efficient as possible

**Design Ideas:**

- Lifting system (lever + pulley)

- Vehicle (wheel & axle + inclined plane)

- Catapult (lever + potential energy)

- Ball run with multiple energy transformations

**Build & Test:**

- Construct your machine

- Test multiple times

- Measure/observe energy transformations

- Improve efficiency

**Part 3: Demonstration (3 minutes)**

- Show machines working

- Explain energy transformations

- Identify simple machines used

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw and label your machine
2. Simple machines used: ___
3. Energy transformations (chain):
4. Write: "Energy conservation shows God's design because..."
5. Write: "Simple machines help by..."

### Closing Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Physics Wonder** — "What amazed you about energy?"
2. **Order in Creation** — "How does energy conservation reflect God's design?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Creator God, thank you for the order and consistency in your creation. Help us use these principles to build things that serve others. Amen."*
