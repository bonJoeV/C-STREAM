---

# Session 8: App Design

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Apply user-centered design to app development

- Navigate MIT App Inventor interface

- Create a functional app prototype

- Consider how apps can serve others

---

# Session 8: App Design

## Materials Needed

- 💻 Computers with App Inventor access

- 📱 Testing devices (or emulator)

- 📝 App design templates

- 📓 Engineering journals

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — Used his programming skills to catalog Eucharistic miracles. He said, "The internet is a gift from God." Apps can serve faith and others!

### Scripture
> *"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."* — Galatians 6:9

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you give us creative abilities to serve others. Help us design apps that make life better for people. Guide our work like Bl. Carlo Acutis used his gifts for your glory. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **Bl. Carlo Acutis:**
   - Young programmer (died at 15)
   - Created Eucharistic miracle website
   - "To always be close to Jesus, that is my life plan"
   - Shows technology serving faith
2. **User-Centered Design:**
   - Apps exist to serve USERS
   - Understand needs before building
   - Test with real people
3. **App Inventor Overview:**
   - MIT-created platform
   - Visual block programming
   - Real Android apps!
   - Designer + Blocks views

### Main Activity: App Development (30 minutes)

**Part 1: User Research & App Concept (8 minutes)**

**Design Thinking for Apps:**

**EMPATHIZE:**

- Who will use this app?

- What do they need?

- What problems do they have?

**DEFINE:**

- "This app will help [user] to [need] by [solution]"

**App Ideas (service-focused):**

- Prayer reminder app

- Good deed tracker

- Kindness challenge app

- Scripture of the day

- Service opportunity finder

- Gratitude journal

- Study helper

- Community connector

**Sketch Your App:**

- Draw 2-3 screens

- Label buttons and features

- Note what each element does

**Part 2: App Inventor Development (18 minutes)**

**Getting Started:**
1. Access ai2.appinventor.mit.edu
2. Create new project
3. Explore Designer view

**Build Your App:**

**Step 1: Design Screen (6 min)**

- Add components:
  - Labels (text display)
  - Buttons (user interaction)
  - TextBox (user input)
  - Image (visuals)

- Arrange layout

- Set properties (colors, text)

**Step 2: Add Logic (8 min)**

- Switch to Blocks view

- Program behaviors:
  - When button clicked → do something
  - Change text
  - Play sound
  - Navigate screens

- Test frequently!

**Step 3: Test & Refine (4 min)**

- Use emulator or device

- Does it work as intended?

- What needs improvement?

**Part 3: Demo (4 minutes)**

- Quick app demonstrations

- Explain user need and solution

- Get feedback

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. App name and purpose: ___
2. User need addressed: ___
3. Screen sketches (label components)
4. Blocks used: ___
5. Write: "Good apps serve users by..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Carlo Acutis Connection** — "How can apps serve others?"
2. **User-Centered Thinking** — "Why start with user needs?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Lord, help us create technology that serves your people. Like Bl. Carlo, may we use our gifts for your glory. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified user need

- [ ] Created functional app elements

- [ ] Applied block programming

- [ ] Considered service purpose

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Template app to modify

- Simpler functionality

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Multiple screens

- Complex interactions

- Data storage features

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Show your app to family! Discuss apps you use—which are well-designed? Research Bl. Carlo Acutis together. Brainstorm: What app would help your family or community?

---

## Teacher Notes

- ai2.appinventor.mit.edu requires Google account

- Emulator works if no Android devices available

- Apps can continue in future sessions

- Consider publishing exceptional apps
