## Catholic Integration

### Theme
**Faith and Reason** — "Science can purify religion from error and superstition; religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes. Each can draw the other into a wider world." — St. John Paul II

### Scripture
> *"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made."* — Romans 1:20

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you are the author of all truth—in faith and in science. Help us see how both reveal your wisdom. Give us minds eager to learn and hearts open to wonder. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (8 minutes)
1. **The Big Question:**
   - "Do faith and science conflict?"
   - Common myth vs. reality
   - History tells a different story!
2. **Catholic Church & Science:**
   - Founded first universities
   - Monks preserved ancient knowledge
   - Priests made major discoveries
   - Vatican Observatory (active today!)
3. **Key Concepts:**
   - **Faith** = Trusting revelation from God
   - **Reason** = Using our minds to discover
   - **Both seek TRUTH** — They complement each other!
   - Science asks "How?" Faith asks "Why?"
