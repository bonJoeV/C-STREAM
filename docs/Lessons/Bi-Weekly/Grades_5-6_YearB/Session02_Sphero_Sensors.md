# Session 2: Sphero Sensors 📡

## Overview
**Grades:** 5-6 | **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Session:** 2 of 17

Students explore advanced sensor capabilities of Sphero BOLT, creating programs that respond to environmental conditions.

---

# Session 2: Sphero Sensors

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand various Sphero BOLT sensors

- Program sensor-based responses

- Create adaptive robot behaviors

- Debug sensor programming

---

# Session 2: Sphero Sensors

## Materials Needed

- 🤖 Sphero BOLT robots (from CSCOE library)

- 📱 Tablets with Sphero Edu

- 🔦 Flashlights (for light sensor)

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🏁 Test environment

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Faustina Kowalska** — She was attuned to God's presence, sensing divine mercy. Our robots sense their environment; we can sense God's love!

### Scripture
> *"The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth."* — Psalm 145:18

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created us with senses to experience your world. Help us program robots that respond intelligently to their environment, just as we respond to your presence in our lives. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Sensors = Robot Senses:**
   - How do YOU sense the world? (5 senses)
   - Robots have sensors too!
2. **Sphero BOLT Sensors:**
   - **Light sensor** — Detects brightness
   - **Gyroscope** — Detects rotation/orientation
   - **Accelerometer** — Detects movement/collision
   - **Compass** — Detects direction
   - **IR (infrared)** — Communicates with other Spheros
3. **Why Sensors Matter:**
   - Makes robots responsive
   - Enables autonomous behavior
   - Real-world robots use these!

### Main Activity: Sensor Programming (31 minutes)

**Part 1: Light Sensor Exploration (10 minutes)**

**Challenge A: Light Follower**

- Program Sphero to respond to light:
  - Bright light → Move forward
  - Dim/dark → Stop or turn

- Use light sensor blocks in Sphero Edu

- Test with flashlight

**Challenge B: Day/Night Mode**

- Different behaviors based on light level:
  - Bright: Fast, white LED
  - Medium: Slow, yellow LED
  - Dark: Stop, blue LED (sleeping!)

**Part 2: Gyroscope & Accelerometer (10 minutes)**

**Challenge C: Collision Response**

- When Sphero hits something:
  - Back up
  - Turn random direction
  - Try again

- Creates autonomous navigation!

**Challenge D: Shake Detector**

- Pick up and shake Sphero

- Trigger special response:
  - Lights flash
  - Sound plays
  - Special movement

**Part 3: Combined Sensor Challenge (8 minutes)**

**Challenge E: Smart Navigator**

- Combine multiple sensors:
  - Move toward light
  - Avoid obstacles (collision)
  - Keep heading straight (compass)

- This is how real autonomous robots work!

**Part 4: Demo & Share (3 minutes)**

- Show your best sensor program

- Explain the logic

- Discuss challenges solved

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your sensor program flowchart
2. Sensors used: ___
3. Behaviors created: ___
4. Write: "Sensors make robots smart because..."
5. Debugging story: What problem did you solve?

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Favorite Sensor** — "Which sensor was most interesting?"
2. **Real-World Connection** — "Where do you see sensors in daily life?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for our senses and the ability to create responsive technology. Help us use these skills to serve others. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Programmed with multiple sensors

- [ ] Created responsive behaviors

- [ ] Debugged sensor programs

- [ ] Understood sensor purposes

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on one sensor at a time

- Template programs to modify

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- All sensors combined

- Create sensor-based game

- Program Sphero-to-Sphero IR communication

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Sensor hunt! Find sensors in your home: motion detectors, light sensors, thermostats, phones. Discuss: How do these make devices "smart"? Research autonomous vehicles and their sensors!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve Sphero BOLTs from CSCOE

- Ensure tablets charged and Sphero Edu installed

- Light sensor works best with contrasting conditions

- Have backup batteries ready
