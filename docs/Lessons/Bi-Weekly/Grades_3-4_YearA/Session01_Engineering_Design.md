# Session 1: Engineering Design 📐

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 1 of 17

Students are introduced to the engineering design process through hands-on exploration and discovery of what engineers do and how they solve problems.

---

# Session 1: Engineering Design

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Define what engineers do

- Identify the steps of the engineering design process

- Complete a quick design challenge

- Connect engineering to serving others

---

# Session 1: Engineering Design

## Materials Needed

- 📋 Engineering Design Process poster

- 📦 Challenge materials (straws, tape, paper)

- 📓 Engineering journals

- ✏️ Pencils and design paper

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Juan Diego** — He wondered at the miracle of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Engineers start with wonder and curiosity about the world!

### Scripture
> *"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works."* — Ephesians 2:10

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you designed the entire universe with wisdom and love. Help us become engineers who use our minds to serve others. Give us curiosity, creativity, and compassion. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (7 minutes)
1. **What is Engineering?**
   - "Engineers solve problems by designing and building solutions!"
   - Examples: buildings, bridges, apps, rockets, medical devices
2. **The Design Process:**
   - **ASK** — What's the problem? Who needs help?
   - **IMAGINE** — Brainstorm many ideas
   - **PLAN** — Choose the best idea, make a plan
   - **CREATE** — Build it!
   - **IMPROVE** — Test, learn, make it better
3. **St. Juan Diego** — Wonder leads to discovery!

### Main Activity: Paper Tower Challenge (25 minutes)

**Part 1: The Challenge (3 minutes)**

- Challenge: Build the tallest freestanding tower using only:
  - 10 sheets of paper
  - 12 inches of tape
  - No other materials!

- Must stand on its own for 10 seconds

**Part 2: Design Process in Action (20 minutes)**

**ASK (2 min):**

- What's our goal? (Tallest tower)

- What are our constraints? (Limited materials)

**IMAGINE (3 min):**

- Sketch at least 3 different tower designs

- Think: rolls, folds, triangles, tubes

**PLAN (2 min):**

- Choose your best idea

- Label parts and estimate height

**CREATE (10 min):**

- Build your tower!

- Work with a partner

- Remember: You can change your plan!

**TEST & IMPROVE (3 min):**

- Measure towers

- Stand back—does it stand for 10 seconds?

- What would you change?

**Part 3: Reflection (2 minutes)**

- Which step was hardest?

- Did your final tower match your plan?

- What did you learn?

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw the engineering design process (circle or flowchart)
2. Sketch your tower design
3. Write: "Engineers help people by..."
4. Write: "I learned that..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Share Towers** — Measure and celebrate!
2. **Process Reflection** — "The design process helped me..."
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for the gift of creativity. Help us use our engineering skills to make the world better. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Can name design process steps

- [ ] Participated in design challenge

- [ ] Made improvements after testing

- [ ] Connected engineering to helping others

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Work in supportive pairs

- Provide visual design process guide

- Fewer constraints on materials

### For Advanced Students

- Add requirement (must hold weight)

- Write about why their design worked

- Research famous engineers

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Find engineering in your home! Who designed your house, your phone, your bike? Try a family challenge: Build the tallest tower using 20 playing cards or 50 pennies.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Post design process permanently in classroom

- Save tower photos for end-of-year comparison

- This lesson introduces vocabulary used all year

- Consider CSCOE KEVA planks for future building
