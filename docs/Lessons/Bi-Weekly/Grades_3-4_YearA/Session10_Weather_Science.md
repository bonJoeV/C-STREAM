## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Elijah the Prophet** — Prayed for rain and God answered. Weather reminds us of God's power and provision!

### Scripture
> *"He covers the sky with clouds; he supplies the earth with rain."* — Psalm 147:8

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you control the wind and rain. Thank you for the weather that waters the earth and sustains life. Help us understand your amazing design. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Weather Wonder:**
   - "Weather affects everything we do!"
   - Farmers, pilots, sailors, athletes—all watch weather
2. **Weather Measurements:**
   - 🌡️ Temperature — How hot or cold
   - 💧 Precipitation — Rain, snow, hail
   - 💨 Wind — Speed and direction
   - ☁️ Clouds — Types predict weather
3. **Water Cycle:**
   - Evaporation → Condensation → Precipitation → Collection
   - God designed a perfect recycling system!

### Main Activity: Weather Station (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Water Cycle Exploration (6 minutes)**

- Review water cycle diagram

- "Where is water RIGHT NOW in the cycle?"

- God's design: Water is never destroyed, just moved!

**Part 2: Build Weather Instruments (16 minutes)**

**Choose ONE to build:**

**Option A: Rain Gauge**

- Clear container (cup or bottle)

- Mark measurements on side

- Collect and measure precipitation

- Place outside to track rainfall

**Option B: Wind Vane**

- Pencil with eraser, pin

- Cardstock arrow shape

- Pin through arrow into eraser

- Arrow points where wind comes FROM

**Option C: Anemometer (Wind Speed)**

- 4 small cups on straws

- Attached to pencil center

- Count spins to estimate wind speed

**Option D: Barometer (Simple)**

- Jar with balloon stretched over top

- Straw attached pointing to scale

- Rising/falling shows pressure changes

**Part 3: Test & Record (4 minutes)**

- Test instruments outside if possible

- Record initial observations

- Predict tomorrow's weather!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your weather instrument (label parts)
2. Draw and label the water cycle
3. Today's weather observation
4. Write: "God designed weather to..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Instrument Share** — How does yours work?
2. **Weather Appreciation** — "Why is weather important?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for rain that grows food and sun that warms us. Help us appreciate your provision in all kinds of weather. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Named weather measurements

- [ ] Understood water cycle

- [ ] Built functional instrument

- [ ] Connected weather to God's design

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Simpler instrument (rain gauge)

- Pre-made parts to assemble

- Partner work

### For Advanced Students

- Build multiple instruments

- Create weather forecast

- Research extreme weather

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Track weather for a week using your instrument! Watch weather forecasts—what do meteorologists measure? Look at clouds and predict weather. Discuss how weather affects your family's activities.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Instruments work best with ongoing tracking

- Connect to classroom weather calendar

- Consider school weather station project

- MN weather provides great variety!
