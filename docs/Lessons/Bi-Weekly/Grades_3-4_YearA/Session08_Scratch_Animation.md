## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Story Power:**
   - "Stories help us remember and share what's important"
   - Bible = stories of God's love

2. **Animation = Moving Stories:**
   - Combine art, writing, and coding
   - Share faith in a new way!
3. **Building on Skills:**
   - Remember Session 5? Now we go further!

### Main Activity: Story Animation (27 minutes)

- Change costumes for action

**Add Scenes (5 min if needed):**

- Use "switch backdrop to"

- Add transitions

**Part 3: Premiere (4 minutes)**

- Share animations (volunteer or all screens visible)

- Celebrate creativity!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Describe your story (3-5 sentences)
2. List 3 new Scratch skills you used
3. Write: "My story teaches..."
4. Sketch one scene from your animation

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
