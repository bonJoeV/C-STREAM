# Session 2: Dash & Code 🤖

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 2 of 17

Students meet Dash robots and learn the basics of programming through block-based coding.

---

# Session 2: Dash & Code

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand what robots are and how they follow instructions

- Navigate the Wonder Workshop app interface

- Program Dash to move and respond

- Debug programs that don't work correctly

---

# Session 2: Dash & Code

## Materials Needed

- 🤖 Dash Robots (from CSCOE library)

- 📱 Tablets with Wonder app installed

- 📋 Programming command cards

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 🎯 Target markers for courses

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — A young tech enthusiast who used technology to spread faith. He'd have loved programming robots!

### Scripture
> *"For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven."* — Ecclesiastes 3:1 (Programs follow sequences in order!)

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created us with minds that can create amazing things. Help us use technology wisely, like Blessed Carlo Acutis. Guide our programming today! Amen.*

---

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Meet Dash!** — "This is Dash, a programmable robot"
2. **Robot Basics:**
   - Robots follow instructions exactly
   - They can't think on their own
   - WE are the "brains"—we write the programs!
3. **Blessed Carlo Acutis:**
   - Teen who loved technology
   - Used it to create a website about Eucharistic miracles
   - "To always be close to Jesus, that's my life plan"
4. **Today's Goal** — "We'll teach Dash to move and make sounds!"

### Main Activity: Programming Dash (26 minutes)

**Part 1: App Introduction (6 minutes)**

- Open Wonder app

- Connect to Dash

- Tour the interface:
  - Command blocks (movement, sounds, lights)
  - Play button
  - Reset/stop

- Demo: Simple "drive forward" command

**Part 2: Guided Challenges (12 minutes)**

**Challenge 1: Square Dance (3 min)**

- Program Dash to drive in a square

- Need: Forward, turn right, forward, turn right... (4 times)

- Test and debug!

**Challenge 2: Light Show (3 min)**

- Program Dash to change colors

- Create a pattern: Red, blue, green, purple

- Add timing between colors

**Challenge 3: Sound & Move (3 min)**

- Combine movement with sounds

- Make Dash "talk" while moving

- Create a personality!

**Challenge 4: Obstacle Approach (3 min)**

- Program Dash to stop when it senses something

- Use sensors in program

- Test with a barrier

**Part 3: Free Exploration (6 minutes)**

- Students explore freely

- Create your own program

- Challenge: Make Dash do something surprising!

**Part 4: Debugging Practice (2 minutes)**

- "If your program didn't work perfectly, that's GOOD!"

- Debugging = finding and fixing problems

- Engineers debug constantly!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw Dash robot
2. Write the commands you used
3. Write: "Debugging taught me..."
4. Write: "I want to program Dash to..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Program Share** — Volunteers show their best program
2. **Carlo's Example** — "He used tech for good—so can we!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for technology that helps us learn. Help us use it wisely. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Successfully connected to Dash

- [ ] Created at least one working program

- [ ] Debugged a non-working program

- [ ] Used multiple command types

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Partner with experienced peer

- Use step-by-step challenge cards

- Focus on 1-2 challenges only

### For Advanced Students

- Create longer programs

- Use variables or loops

- Design program for specific story

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Talk about robots in everyday life: vacuums, car systems, factory machines. Try block coding at home with Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) - it's free! Watch videos about how robots are programmed.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve Dash robots 2+ weeks in advance

- Ensure tablets are charged

- Have backup activities if tech fails

- Students will use Dash again in Session 14

- Consider grouping if not enough robots
