## Catholic Integration

### Theme
**Faith and Reason** — The Church has always supported science as a way to understand God's creation better!

### Scripture
> *"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."* — Psalm 19:1

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you gave us minds to explore your creation. Thank you for the many faithful scientists who sought to understand your world. Inspire us to use reason and faith together. Amen.*

2. **Science & Faith Partners:**
   - The Church has ALWAYS supported science
   - Many scientists were Catholic priests, nuns, laypeople
   - "Studying creation helps us know the Creator!"
3. **Famous Examples:**
   - Fr. Georges Lemaître — Big Bang Theory

   - Galileo — Despite the conflict, he remained Catholic!

### Main Activity: Scientist Research (27 minutes)

**Part 1: Choose Your Scientist (2 minutes)**

- Select from list:
  - **Fr. Georges Lemaître** — Big Bang Theory
  - **Gregor Mendel** — Genetics & heredity
  - **Louis Pasteur** — Vaccines, germ theory
  - **Bl. Nicolas Steno** — Geology founder
  - **Maria Gaetana Agnesi** — Mathematics
  - **Jérôme Lejeune** — Down syndrome research
  - **Sister Mary Kenneth Keller** — Computer science pioneer
  - **Br. Guy Consolmagno** — Vatican astronomer (alive today!)

**Part 2: Research (12 minutes)**
Use the scientist profile sheet:

- Name and life dates

- What did they study/discover?

- How did their faith influence their work?

- Interesting fact

- Why does their work matter today?

**Part 3: Create Presentation (10 minutes)**

- Create poster OR digital slide OR oral presentation

- Include:
  - Scientist name and image
  - Key discovery
  - Faith connection
  - Impact today

**Part 4: Gallery Walk/Presentations (3 minutes)**

- Quick share: "My scientist is... They discovered..."

- Full presentations can continue next session or be displayed

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Write about your scientist
2. Write: "Faith and science go together because..."
3. Draw your scientist or their discovery
4. Write: "I was surprised that..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Key Learning** — "What surprised you about Catholic scientists?"
