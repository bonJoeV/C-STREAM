## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Joseph the Worker** — As a carpenter, he used simple machines every day to build and create. Feast day: May 1st!

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."* — Colossians 3:23

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, like St. Joseph who worked with his hands, help us appreciate the tools that make work easier. Thank you for simple machines that multiply our effort. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **What is Work?**
   - Physics: Work = Force × Distance
   - Moving something takes energy/effort
2. **Simple Machines:**
   - Tools that make work EASIER
   - They don't reduce work, they change HOW we do it
3. **The Six Simple Machines:**
   - 🪜 **Inclined Plane** — Ramp
   - 🪵 **Wedge** — Ax, knife
   - 🔩 **Screw** — Spiral inclined plane
   - ⚖️ **Lever** — Seesaw, crowbar
   - 🛞 **Wheel & Axle** — Doorknob, car
   - 🪢 **Pulley** — Flagpole, blinds

### Main Activity: Simple Machine Stations (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Station Rotation (18 minutes)**
Set up 3 stations, rotate every 6 minutes:

**Station 1: Lever Experiments**

- Build levers with different fulcrum positions

- Test: Where is it easiest to lift a weight?

- Discover: Closer fulcrum = less effort needed

- Identify lever classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

**Station 2: Inclined Plane & Wedge**

- Test ramps at different angles

- Measure effort to push objects up

- Discover: Longer ramp = less effort

- See how wedge splits/cuts

**Station 3: Wheel/Axle & Pulley**

- Test wheel and axle advantage

- Use simple pulley to lift weight

- Discover: Pulley changes direction of force

- Compare lifting with and without machines

**Part 2: Find Simple Machines (5 minutes)**

- Identify simple machines in classroom

- Scissors = lever + wedge

- Doorknob = wheel and axle

- List as many as possible!

**Part 3: Design Challenge (3 minutes)**

- Quick sketch: Design a machine using 2+ simple machines

- Share ideas!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw and label all 6 simple machines
2. Write: "Simple machines make work easier by..."
3. List 5 simple machines you found in the classroom
4. Sketch your machine design idea

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Discovery Share** — "Which simple machine surprised you most?"
2. **St. Joseph Connection** — "What machines would he have used?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, thank you for tools that help us work. Like St. Joseph, may we work with joy and skill. Amen."*

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Simple machine scavenger hunt at home! How many can you find? Identify the simple machines in tools, toys, and household items. Try building a simple machine to solve a problem!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Simple Machine Kit available from CSCOE

- Great connection to St. Joseph the Worker (May 1)

- Connect to playground equipment

- Consider KEVA or LEGO for building
