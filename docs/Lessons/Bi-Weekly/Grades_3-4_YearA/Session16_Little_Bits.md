## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**Blessed Carlo Acutis** — Used technology creatively for good. He'd have loved inventing with Little Bits!

### Scripture
> *"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others."* — 1 Peter 4:10

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you sparked the gift of creativity in us. Help us use electronics and inventions to bring joy and help others. Guide our designs today. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **Meet Little Bits:**
   - "Electronic building blocks that snap together!"
   - Color-coded for easy understanding
2. **Circuit Parts:**
   - 🔵 **Blue** = Power (batteries)
   - 🟢 **Green** = Outputs (lights, sounds, motors)
   - 🩷 **Pink** = Inputs (buttons, sensors)
   - 🟠 **Orange** = Wires (connect pieces)
3. **Rule:** Power → Inputs → Outputs
4. **Blessed Carlo Acutis** — Used tech for good!

### Main Activity: Little Bits Exploration (27 minutes)

**Part 1: Basic Circuits (7 minutes)**

- Build: Power + Output
  - Connect power to LED
  - See it light up!

- Add: Power + Input + Output
  - Add button between power and LED
  - Now it's controlled!

- Experiment with different outputs:
  - Buzzer
  - Motor
  - LED

**Part 2: Sensor Exploration (8 minutes)**

- Try different inputs:
  - Light sensor
  - Sound sensor
  - Dimmer

- Create "if-then" circuits:
  - IF dark, THEN light on
  - IF sound, THEN motor spins

- How could these help people?

**Part 3: Invention Challenge (10 minutes)**

**Challenge:** Design something useful or joyful!

Ideas:

- Night light (light sensor + LED)

- Doorbell (button + buzzer)

- Greeting card with sound

- Spinning display

- Alarm system

Steps:
1. Choose your purpose
2. Select components
3. Build and test
4. Improve!
5. Mount on craft material if desired

**Part 4: Invention Fair (2 minutes)**

- Quick share: "My invention is... It does..."

- Celebrate creativity!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your circuit (label Power, Input, Output)
2. Write: "My invention..."
3. Write: "It helps/creates joy by..."
4. Write: "I could improve it by..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Invention Appreciation** — "What creative ideas did you see?"
2. **Technology for Good** — "How can inventions serve others?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for the gift of invention. Help us use technology to make the world better and bring joy to others. Amen."*
