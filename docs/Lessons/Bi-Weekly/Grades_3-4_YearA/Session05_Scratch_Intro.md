## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**God as the Master Programmer** — God created the universe with order and logic, just like programmers create with code!

### Scripture
> *"In the beginning was the Word... Through him all things were made."* — John 1:1,3

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you created the universe with perfect order and logic. As we learn to program, help us appreciate your incredible design. Guide our creativity today! Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (5 minutes)
1. **What is Scratch?**
   - "A programming language where you connect blocks like puzzle pieces!"
   - Created at MIT for learning to code
   - Used by millions of kids worldwide
2. **Programming = Giving Instructions**
   - Computers do EXACTLY what we tell them
   - We need to be precise and logical
3. **God's Code** — The universe runs on God's perfect design

### Main Activity: Scratch Exploration (27 minutes)

**Part 1: Interface Tour (5 minutes)**

- **Stage** — Where the action happens

- **Sprites** — Characters and objects

- **Code Blocks** — Instructions that snap together

- **Categories:**
  - 🎬 Motion — Move and turn
  - 👀 Looks — Appearance and speech
  - 🔊 Sound — Sounds and music
  - 🎮 Events — Triggers (when clicked, etc.)
  - 🔁 Control — Loops and waits

**Part 2: Guided Activity: Make the Cat Dance! (12 minutes)**

**Step 1: Basic Motion (3 min)**

- Find "move 10 steps" block

- Snap under "when green flag clicked"

- Click green flag to test

- Try different numbers!

**Step 2: Add Turning (3 min)**

- Add "turn 15 degrees"

- See what happens

- Create a spinning cat!

**Step 3: Loops & Waiting (3 min)**

- Find "forever" block (in Control)

- Put motion blocks INSIDE the loop

- Add "wait 0.5 seconds"

- The cat dances forever!

**Step 4: Add Speech (3 min)**

- Find "say Hello for 2 seconds"

- What should your cat say?

- Add sound blocks if time

**Part 3: Free Creation (8 minutes)**

- Customize YOUR cat:
  - Change costume (Looks: next costume)
  - Add more movements
  - Make it say something meaningful
  - Add sounds

- Explore other sprites if time

**Part 4: Demo Showcase (2 minutes)**

- Volunteers show their dancing cats

- Celebrate creativity!

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw the Scratch interface (Stage, Sprites, Blocks)
2. List 3 block types you used
3. Write: "Programming is like..."
4. Write: "I want to create a program that..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Share Discoveries** — "What cool thing did your cat do?"
2. **Logic Appreciation** — "God's creation follows logic too!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for minds that can create and problem-solve. Bless our coding adventures! Amen."*

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Paired with experienced peer

- Step-by-step visual guide

- Focus on basic motion only

### For Advanced Students

- Add multiple sprites

- Create sprite interaction

- Explore variables

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Scratch is FREE at scratch.mit.edu! Create an account and explore together. Try the tutorials. Show your family the dancing cat you made! Find Scratch project ideas online.
