## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Lucy** — Her name means "light"! She brought light in dark times, celebrated during Advent.

### Scripture
> *"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness."* — John 8:12

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, you are the Light of the World. As we prepare for Christmas during Advent, help us bring your light to others. Illuminate our minds as we learn about circuits today. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Advent Season:**
   - "We're preparing for Jesus' birth!"
   - Light grows as we get closer to Christmas
   - Advent wreath adds candles each week
2. **Jesus = Light:**
   - "Jesus brings light to our darkness"
   - St. Lucy brought light too!
3. **Circuit Basics:**
   - Electricity flows in a LOOP (circuit = circle)
   - Need: Power source, conductor, output (light)
4. **Today** — "Create a light that reminds us of Jesus!"

### Main Activity: Circuit Creation (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Circuit Science (6 minutes)**

- **Demonstration:**
  - Battery = power source
  - Copper tape = conductor (lets electricity flow)
  - LED = output (makes light)
  - Circuit must be COMPLETE (loop)

- **Try It:**
  - Touch LED legs to battery sides
  - Long leg = positive (+)
  - Short leg = negative (-)
  - See it light up!

**Part 2: Advent Light Card (16 minutes)**

**Design (3 min):**

- Plan your Advent light card

- Ideas: Advent wreath, Christmas star, manger, candle, cross

- Where will the light shine?

**Build Circuit (10 min):**
1. Fold cardstock
2. Mark LED placement (poke small holes)
3. Create copper tape path:
   - One strip from battery + to LED long leg
   - One strip from battery - to LED short leg
4. Insert LED, tape battery in place
5. Add switch (folded paper that connects when pressed)
6. Decorate front of card!

**Test & Troubleshoot (3 min):**

- Does it light up?

- If not: Check connections, battery position, LED direction

- Debugging is engineering!

**Part 3: Gallery & Celebration (4 minutes)**

- Light up all the cards!

- "Look at the light we're bringing!"

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your circuit (label parts)
2. Write: "A circuit works by..."
3. Write: "Light reminds me of Jesus because..."
4. Who will you give your card to?

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Light Display** — Everyone lights their card together
2. **Advent Meaning** — "We prepare for the Light of the World!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Jesus, help us be lights in the darkness. May our Advent be filled with preparation and hope. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Built working circuit

- [ ] Understood circuit components

- [ ] Connected light to faith theme

- [ ] Troubleshot problems

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Pre-made circuit templates

- Partner assistance

- Simpler design

### For Advanced Students

- Multiple LEDs

- Blinking circuit (if materials allow)

- Create switch mechanism

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Give your light card to someone special! Notice lights in Advent: wreaths, Christmas lights, candles. Discuss how Jesus brings light. Find other examples of circuits at home!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Test all batteries before class

- Have extra supplies for mistakes

- Copper tape can be tricky—practice first

- Cards make great gifts for parents/grandparents

- Consider making class Advent wreath display
