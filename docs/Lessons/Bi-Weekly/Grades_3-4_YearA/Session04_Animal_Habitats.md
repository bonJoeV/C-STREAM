# Session 4: Animal Habitats 🦎

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 4 of 17

Students explore how animals are designed for their habitats and create habitat models demonstrating this connection.

---

# Session 4: Animal Habitats

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Define habitat and identify its components

- Explain how animals are adapted to their habitats

- Design and build a habitat model

- Connect habitat design to God's providence

---

# Session 4: Animal Habitats

## Materials Needed

- 📸 Pictures of various habitats/animals

- 📦 Habitat model materials (boxes, craft supplies)

- 🌿 Natural materials (if available)

- 📓 Engineering journals

- 📋 Habitat component checklist

---

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — Patron saint of animals and ecology! He saw all creatures as brothers and sisters.

### Scripture
> *"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them."* — Matthew 6:26

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you designed each creature perfectly for its home. Like St. Francis, help us appreciate and protect all living things. Thank you for the wonder of habitats! Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **What is a Habitat?**
   - "A habitat is an animal's HOME—where it finds everything it needs"
2. **Habitat Components (Four Things Needed):**
   - 🍽️ **Food** — What does it eat?
   - 💧 **Water** — How does it get water?
   - 🏠 **Shelter** — Where does it hide/sleep?
   - 🌡️ **Space** — Room to move and live
3. **Perfect Design** — "God designed each animal for its habitat!"
4. **St. Francis** — Loved all creatures

### Main Activity: Habitat Design Challenge (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Habitat Exploration (6 minutes)**

- Explore habitat types:
  - 🌲 **Forest** — Trees, seasons, varied animals
  - 🏜️ **Desert** — Hot, dry, special adaptations
  - 🌊 **Ocean** — Saltwater, pressure, water-breathing
  - 🧊 **Arctic** — Cold, ice, thick fur/blubber
  - 🌿 **Rainforest** — Wet, layers, biodiversity

- Pick ONE habitat to design

**Part 2: Design & Build (16 minutes)**

**Choose Animal & Habitat (2 min):**

- Select habitat type

- Choose animal for that habitat

- Think: How is this animal designed for its home?

**Design (3 min):**

- Sketch habitat model

- Include all 4 components: food, water, shelter, space

- Label adaptations

**Build (11 min):**

- Create 3D habitat model in box or on paper plate

- Show:
  - Where food comes from
  - Water source
  - Shelter/hiding spots
  - Space for movement

- Add your animal (drawn or craft)

**Part 3: Habitat Showcase (4 minutes)**

- Gallery walk to see habitats

- Presenters explain: "My animal survives because..."

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Draw your habitat model
2. Label: Food, Water, Shelter, Space
3. Write: "My animal is designed for its habitat because..."
4. Write: "God shows care for animals by..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Design Appreciation** — "What amazed you about animal adaptations?"
2. **Stewardship** — "How can we protect habitats?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for designing animals perfectly for their homes. Help us be good stewards of your creation. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified habitat components

- [ ] Connected animal adaptations to habitat

- [ ] Created habitat model with all 4 components

- [ ] Explained animal's survival design

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Habitat template with labeled sections

- Partner work

- Focus on familiar animals

### For Advanced Students

- Research specific adaptations

- Compare two animals in same habitat

- Include food chain in model

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** What's YOUR habitat? List the food, water, shelter, and space in your home! Watch nature documentaries about different habitats. Visit a zoo and observe how exhibits recreate natural habitats.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Connect to standards on habitats and adaptations

- Consider outdoor observation of local habitat

- Coordinate with science curriculum

- Habitats can be displayed for parents
