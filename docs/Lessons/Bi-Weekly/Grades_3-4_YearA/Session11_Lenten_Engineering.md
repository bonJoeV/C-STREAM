## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Vincent de Paul** — Organized charity and service in creative, systematic ways. He was an "engineer of charity"!

### Scripture
> *"Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."* — James 2:17

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, during Lent we prepare our hearts for Easter. Help us turn our faith into action by serving others. Guide our designs to help those in need. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Lent Season:**
   - Preparing for Easter
   - Prayer, Fasting, Almsgiving
   - 40 days of growing closer to God
2. **St. Vincent de Paul:**
   - Didn't just feel sorry for poor—he ORGANIZED help
   - Created systems to serve more people
   - "Engineering" charity!
3. **Our Challenge:**
   - Use our skills to SERVE
   - Engineers solve problems—what problems can we solve?

### Main Activity: Service Design Sprint (26 minutes)

**Part 1: Identify Needs (5 minutes)**
Discussion: Who needs help in our community?

- Elderly neighbors (lonely, need help)

- Homeless (need food, warmth, dignity)

- Sick classmates (need encouragement)

- Environment (needs care)

- Hungry families (need food)

- School community (what needs improvement?)

Select ONE need to address.

**Part 2: Design Sprint (17 minutes)**

**EMPATHIZE (3 min):**

- Who specifically needs help?

- What's their experience like?

- What would REALLY help them?

**IDEATE (3 min):**

- Brainstorm many ideas

- Wild ideas welcome!

- Combine ideas

**PROTOTYPE (8 min):**
Create a prototype or detailed plan:

- Build model if physical solution

- Write detailed plan if service action

- Create presentation if digital solution

Example Projects:

- Blessing bags assembly system (organize supplies)

- Encouragement card delivery system

- School recycling station design

- Senior visit planning system

- Food drive collection optimizer

**SHARE (3 min):**

- Present to partner or group

- Get feedback

- Refine idea

**Part 3: Action Planning (4 minutes)**

- What can we ACTUALLY do?

- What's our first step?

- Who can help us implement this?

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Describe the need you identified
2. Draw your solution design
3. Write: "My plan will help by..."
4. Write: "My first step is..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Commitment** — "What will you DO for Lent?"
2. **Engineering for Good** — "How can design thinking help others?"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Jesus, help us be like St. Vincent de Paul—turning compassion into action. Bless our Lenten service. Amen."*
