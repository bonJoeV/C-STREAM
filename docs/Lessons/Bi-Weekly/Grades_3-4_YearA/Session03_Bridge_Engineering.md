# Session 3: Bridge Engineering 🌉

## Overview
**Grades:** 3-4 | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Session:** 3 of 17

Students explore bridge engineering principles and build bridges using KEVA planks, testing their structures for strength.

---

# Session 3: Bridge Engineering

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Identify different bridge types and their features

- Understand how triangles add strength

- Build and test a bridge structure

- Apply the engineering design process

---

# Session 3: Bridge Engineering

## Materials Needed

- 📦 KEVA Planks (from CSCOE library)

- 📸 Bridge type pictures

- 🪙 Weights for testing (coins, washers)

- 📏 Rulers for measuring span

- 📓 Engineering journals

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Patrick** — Built "bridges" between people and faith in Ireland. He connected communities!

### Scripture
> *"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"* — Romans 10:15 (Bridges help spread good news!)

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you connect heaven and earth. Like St. Patrick who built bridges of faith, help us build structures that connect and serve others. Amen.*

---

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (6 minutes)
1. **Bridge Purpose** — "Bridges connect people and places!"
2. **Bridge Types:**
   - **Beam** — Simple, flat across supports
   - **Arch** — Curved, pushes weight outward
   - **Truss** — Uses triangles for strength
   - **Suspension** — Hangs from cables
3. **Triangles = Strength** — Demonstrate with hands
4. **St. Patrick** — Connected communities through faith

### Main Activity: Bridge Building Challenge (26 minutes)

**Part 1: The Challenge (3 minutes)**

- Build a bridge that:
  - Spans at least 8 inches (between two books)
  - Can hold weight
  - Uses only KEVA planks

- Success = Most weight held without collapse!

**Part 2: Design & Build (18 minutes)**

**IMAGINE (3 min):**

- Sketch your bridge design

- Label: supports, deck, special features

- Which bridge type will you use?

**PLAN (2 min):**

- Estimate planks needed

- Decide where to start building

**CREATE (11 min):**

- Build your bridge!

- Remember: Triangles add strength

- Test balance before adding weight

**TEST (2 min):**

- Add weights one at a time

- Count how many before collapse

- Record your results

**Part 3: Analysis (5 minutes)**

- Which bridges held the most weight?

- What designs worked best? Why?

- How could you improve?

- Class discussion of findings

### Engineering Journal (5 minutes)
1. Sketch your bridge design (before and after building)
2. Record: "My bridge held ___ weights"
3. Write: "Triangles help bridges by..."
4. Write: "Next time I would..."

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Celebrate Successes** — Recognize strong bridges
2. **Real Bridges** — Where do you see bridges in our community?
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"God, help us be bridge builders—connecting people with love and service. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Identified bridge types

- [ ] Created design before building

- [ ] Built stable bridge structure

- [ ] Tested and recorded results

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Provide starter bridge base

- Work with partner

- Simplified span requirement

### For Advanced Students

- Longer span requirement

- Design constraints (limited planks)

- Research famous bridges

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Find bridges in your community! What type are they? Why were they designed that way? Build a bridge at home using blocks, straws, or popsicle sticks. Test with toy cars!

---

## Teacher Notes

- Reserve KEVA planks from CSCOE library

- Clear large floor/table space

- Use books for stable supports

- Take photos for portfolio

- Connect to local bridge examples
