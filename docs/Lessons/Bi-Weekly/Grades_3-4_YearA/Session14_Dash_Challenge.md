## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Thomas Aquinas** — Used logical thinking to solve complex problems. Programming requires similar logical reasoning!

### Scripture
> *"Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete."* — James 1:4

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you gave us minds that can solve complex problems. Help us persevere through challenges today. When things are hard, give us patience and creativity. Amen.*
