## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Francis of Assisi** — He loved all animals and saw them as brothers and sisters in God's creation!

### Scripture
> *"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them."* — Matthew 6:26

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you take care of all animals. You gave birds nests to live in, fish water to swim in, and rabbits burrows to hide in. Help us care for animals too. Amen.*
