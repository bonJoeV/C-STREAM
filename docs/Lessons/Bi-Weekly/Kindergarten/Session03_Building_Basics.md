# Session 03: Building Basics

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand that engineers build things to help people

- Stack blocks to build a tall tower

- Learn from "failures" (things that fall down)

- Practice persistence when building

---

## Materials Needed

- 📦 KEVA Planks (from CSCOE library) OR wooden blocks

- 📏 "Measure stick" (craft stick for height comparison)

- 📷 Pictures of tall buildings

- 🖍️ Wonder Journals and crayons

- 📋 Tower Challenge chart (1st try, 2nd try, 3rd try)

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Joseph the Worker** — Jesus's foster father was a carpenter who built things with his hands!

### Scripture
> *"Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain."* — Psalm 127:1

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for people who build things that help us. Help us learn to build with patience and kindness. Bless our hands as we work today. Amen.*

---

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Wonder Song**
2. **Show Pictures** — Tall buildings, bridges, houses
   - "Who builds these things?" (Engineers, builders, architects)
   - "Why do people build things?" (To help others!)
3. **Today's Challenge** — "We're going to be builders!"

### Main Activity: Tower Challenge (15 minutes)

**Part 1: Free Exploration (3 minutes)**

- Give each pair a pile of KEVA Planks or blocks

- "See what you can build!"

- Let students explore freely

**Part 2: Tower Challenge (10 minutes)**

- "Now let's see how TALL we can build!"

- Challenge: Build a tower that stands by itself

- **When towers fall:** 
  - "What happened? What can we try differently?"
  - "Engineers try again and again!"
  - Celebrate learning from "failures"

- Use measure stick to compare heights

**Part 3: Celebrate & Clean (2 minutes)**

- Count: "How many blocks in your tallest tower?"

- Careful cleanup together

### Wonder Journal (3 minutes)
1. Draw your tower
2. Circle: 😊 (easy) or 😤 (tricky) or 🎉 (proud)

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Share** — What made building tricky? What helped?
2. **Connection** — "St. Joseph built things to help his family!"
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for hands that can build and minds that can solve problems. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Attempted to stack blocks

- [ ] Tried again after blocks fell

- [ ] Cooperated with partner

- [ ] Participated in reflection

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Use larger blocks

- Build together with teacher support

- Focus on 3-block tower success

### For Advanced Students

- Challenge: Build something specific (house, bridge)

- Use only one hand

- Count blocks and compare quantities

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Build towers at home using household items (boxes, plastic cups, blocks). How tall can you build before it falls? Talk about why some things stack better than others.

---

## Teacher Notes

- "Failure" is reframed as LEARNING in engineering

- Use encouraging language: "Your tower is teaching you something!"

- Reserve KEVA Planks from CSCOE Library 2 weeks in advance
