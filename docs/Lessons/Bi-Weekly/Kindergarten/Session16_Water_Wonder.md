# Session 16: Water Wonder

## Overview
**Grade:** Kindergarten | **Duration:** 25 minutes | **Session:** 16 of 17

Students explore water properties through sink/float experiments, learning about this essential gift from God.

---

# Session 16: Water Wonder

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Predict and test whether objects sink or float

- Observe properties of water

- Understand water is essential for life

- Appreciate water as God's gift

---

## Materials Needed

- 📦 Large tub or bin with water

- 🧪 Test objects: cork, penny, leaf, rock, plastic cap, crayon, sponge, foil ball

- 📋 Sink/Float chart

- 🧻 Towels for cleanup

- 🖍️ Wonder Journals and crayons

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. John the Baptist** — He baptized Jesus in the water of the Jordan River! Water reminds us of our baptism.

### Scripture
> *"Whoever believes in me, rivers of living water will flow from within them."* — John 7:38

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for the gift of water. Water gives us life—we drink it, plants need it, animals need it. Thank you for the water of our baptism. Help us take care of water and share it with others. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Water Importance** — "Why do we need water?"
   - Drinking
   - Washing
   - Plants growing
   - Animals living
   - BAPTISM!
2. **Wonder Question** — "When you drop things in water, what happens?"
3. **Prediction** — Show objects: "Do you think this will sink or float?"
4. **Today's Experiment** — "Let's find out!"

### Main Activity: Sink or Float Investigation (15 minutes)

**Part 1: Predictions (3 minutes)**

- Show each object

- Students predict: sink (thumbs down) or float (thumbs up)

- Record on class chart

**Part 2: Testing (9 minutes)**

- One at a time, test objects in water

- Students observe: "What happened?"

- Record results on chart

- Discuss: "Why do you think that happened?"

- Key objects to test:
  - Cork (floats) — light!
  - Penny (sinks) — heavy!
  - Leaf (floats) — light and flat!
  - Rock (sinks) — heavy!
  - Plastic cap (floats)
  - Sponge (floats then... absorbs water!)

**Part 3: Discoveries (3 minutes)**

- "What did we learn about sink and float?"

- "Were any predictions wrong? That's okay—scientists learn from surprises!"

- Try making a foil boat — can it float AND hold a penny?

### Wonder Journal (3 minutes)
1. Draw one thing that sinks and one that floats
2. Add water (blue waves)

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Wonder Share** — "What surprised you?"
2. **Water Care** — "How can we take care of water?"
   - Don't waste it
   - Keep it clean
   - Be thankful for it
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for wonderful water. Help us use it wisely and share it with those who need it. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Made predictions before testing

- [ ] Observed and described results

- [ ] Compared predictions to results

- [ ] Connected water to God's gifts

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on 3-4 clear examples

- Hand-over-hand object dropping

- Simpler prediction (yes/no rather than reasoning)

### For Advanced Students

- Predict AND explain reasoning

- Test additional objects

- Try to make sinking objects float (foil boat)

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Do sink/float experiments in the bathtub or kitchen sink! Gather objects and test them. Try making a foil boat that can hold pennies. How many pennies before it sinks?

---

## Teacher Notes

- Prepare towels and have smocks available

- Do experiment on easy-to-clean surface

- This is a high-engagement lesson—expect excitement!

- Connect to water conservation discussions
