# Session 05: Simple Machines

## Overview
**Grade:** Kindergarten | **Duration:** 25 minutes | **Session:** 5 of 17

Students discover how ramps (inclined planes) make work easier, exploring how things roll and slide.

---

# Session 05: Simple Machines

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand that ramps help move things

- Predict and test which objects roll

- Compare steep vs. gentle ramps

- See how simple machines help people

---

## Materials Needed

- 📦 Ramp boards (cardboard, books, or boards)

- 🎾 Rolling objects (balls, toy cars, cylinders)

- 📦 Non-rolling objects (blocks, crayons, toy animals)

- 📏 Masking tape (for starting lines)

- 🖍️ Wonder Journals and crayons

## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Isidore the Farmer** — He used simple tools and machines to help grow food for others!

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."* — Colossians 3:23

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, thank you for giving people ideas to make work easier. Help us use our minds to solve problems and help others. Amen.*

---

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Wonder Question** — "How do we get heavy things to move?"
2. **Show Ramp** — "This is called a RAMP or an inclined plane"
3. **Real-World Examples** — Wheelchair ramps, slides, driveways
4. **Prediction** — Hold up a ball: "What will happen if I put this on the ramp?"

### Main Activity: Ramp Exploration (15 minutes)

**Part 1: Roll or Not? (5 minutes)**

- Set up ramps around the room

- Students predict: Will it roll? 🎾 or stay? 📦

- Test various objects

- Sort into "Rollers" and "Stayers"

**Part 2: Steep vs. Gentle (7 minutes)**

- Make ramps at different heights

- **Challenge Questions:**
  - Which ramp makes things go faster?
  - Which ramp makes things go farther?
  - Which ramp would be easier to push a heavy box up?

- Students test and observe

**Part 3: Race Time! (3 minutes)**

- Partner races: Which object rolls fastest?

- Celebrate discoveries!

### Wonder Journal (3 minutes)
1. Draw a ramp with something rolling
2. Draw what happened!

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Discovery Share** — "What did you learn about ramps?"
2. **Helping Others** — "How do ramps help people?" (wheelchairs, strollers, carts)
3. **Closing Prayer** — *"Thank you, God, for simple machines that help us. Help us always think of ways to help others. Amen."*

## Assessment
**Observation Checklist:**

- [ ] Made predictions before testing

- [ ] Identified which objects roll

- [ ] Noticed differences between steep/gentle ramps

- [ ] Connected ramps to helping people

---

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on two clear comparisons (ball vs. block)

- Work one-on-one during exploration

- Use hand-over-hand to place objects

### For Advanced Students

- Measure how far objects travel

- Create a ramp from classroom materials

- Predict and test multiple variables

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Find ramps in your neighborhood! Look for wheelchair ramps, slides, driveways, parking garage ramps. Make a ramp at home with a book and test what rolls. What goes fastest?

---

## Teacher Notes

- Simple machines kit available from CSCOE library

- Heavy books make good ramp supports

- This connects to future physics concepts (gravity, friction)
