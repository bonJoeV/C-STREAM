## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Vincent de Paul** — He dedicated his life to helping the poor. He said, "We should help the poor in every way!"

### Scripture
> *"Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."* — Matthew 25:40

### Opening Prayer
*Dear Jesus, you taught us to love one another. Help us find ways to help people who need kindness. Bless the work of our hands today. Amen.*
