## Catholic Integration

### Saint Connection
**St. Bernard of Menthon** — He helped travelers in snowy mountains and trained rescue dogs!

### Scripture
> *"He gives snow like wool; he scatters frost like ashes."* — Psalm 147:16

### Opening Prayer
*Dear God, you made the seasons change. Thank you for winter's beauty—the snow, the ice, the cozy times inside. Help us care for animals and people who need extra help in winter. Amen.*

## Lesson Procedure

### Opening Circle (4 minutes)
1. **Winter Wonder** — "What do you notice in winter?"
2. **Seasonal Change** — "God made our world so it changes through the year!"
3. **Today's Exploration** — "We're going to be winter scientists!"
4. **Safety Note** — "Ice is very cold—we can touch briefly but not too long!"

### Main Activity: Winter Exploration Stations (15 minutes)
*Rotate through stations or choose focus activities*

**Station 1: Ice Observation (5 minutes)**

- Feel ice cubes (briefly!)

- Watch ice melt in your hand

- "What's happening? Where does the water come from?"

- Try: What makes ice melt faster? (salt, warm hands)

**Station 2: Frozen Discovery (5 minutes)**

- Small toys frozen in ice cubes/blocks

- How can we get the toy out?

- Try salt, warm water, waiting

- "Ice is water that got very, very cold!"

**Station 3: Winter Animals (5 minutes)**

- Pictures/toys of winter animals

- How do animals stay warm?
  - Bears hibernate (sleep)
  - Birds fly south
  - Squirrels gather food
  - Dogs grow thicker fur

- "God gave animals ways to survive winter!"

### Wonder Journal (3 minutes)
1. Draw something you learned about winter
2. Add snowflakes around your drawing!

### Closing Circle (3 minutes)
1. **Discovery Share** — "What surprised you about ice?"
2. **Caring in Winter** — "How can we help animals and people in winter?"
   - Feed birds

## Differentiation

### For Students Who Need Support

- Focus on one station with teacher

- Use mittens for ice handling

- Simpler comparison (cold vs. warm)

### For Advanced Students

- Time how long ice takes to melt

- Draw before/after pictures

- List multiple animals and their winter strategies

---

## Wonder at Home 🏠
**Family Activity:** Freeze small toys in ice and let your child figure out how to free them! Talk about what makes ice melt. Look for icicles and animal tracks in the snow.

---

## Teacher Notes

- Prepare ice blocks day before (freeze toys in containers)

- Have towels ready for water

- Consider bringing in real snow if available

- Great time to collect winter clothes for donation
