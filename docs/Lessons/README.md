## 🔄 Curriculum Flexibility Options

C-STREAM offers flexible scheduling to meet your school's needs:

### Year A / Year B Rotation (Grades 1-6)
For schools with **combined grade classrooms** (1-2, 3-4, 5-6), we provide a **two-year rotation**:

- **Year A:** Complete curriculum with one set of projects and contexts

- **Year B:** Same skills and concepts with *different* projects, saints, and applications

This ensures students don't repeat identical content when they remain in a combined classroom for two years. **Kindergarten does not require Year A/B** since students advance to 1st grade.

### Weekly vs. Bi-Weekly Scheduling

- **Weekly (34 sessions):** Full curriculum for schools with STREAM every week

- **Bi-Weekly (17 sessions):** Condensed curriculum for schools with STREAM every other week
