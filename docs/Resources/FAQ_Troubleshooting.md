## Getting Started

### "I'm overwhelmed. Where do I even begin?"

**Start simple!** 
1. Read the [Quick Start Guide](./Quick_Start_Guide.md)
2. Just focus on Week 1 — it's designed to be easy
3. You don't need fancy equipment to begin
4. It's okay to learn alongside your students

### "Do I need a science background to teach C-STREAM?"

**No!** C-STREAM is designed for generalist teachers. The lessons include:

- Step-by-step instructions

- Background information you need

- Simple explanations of concepts

- You model curiosity and learning, not expertise

### "What's the difference between Year A and Year B?"

Both years cover the same core skills with different projects and contexts. If your school uses a two-year rotation (e.g., combined 1-2 grade classroom), students in Year A get different content than Year B, so they never repeat.

**Check with your administration** which year your school is on.

### "How is C-STREAM different from regular STEM?"

The "C" stands for Catholic! C-STREAM intentionally:

- Connects every lesson to faith

- Highlights Catholic scientists

- Emphasizes service and helping others

- Sees wonder and curiosity as gifts from God

- Integrates Catholic Social Teaching

## Time Management

### "My lesson ran way too long. What do I do?"

**It happens to everyone!** Options:
1. **Stop gracefully:** "We'll continue next week!"
2. **Skip the share/reflection:** Go straight to closing prayer
3. **Simplify:** Next time, do fewer steps
4. **Learn:** Note which part took longer for future planning

### "My lesson was too short. Now what?"

**Stretch activities:**

- Extended sharing: "Turn to a partner and explain..."

- Wonder questions: "What else do you wonder about this?"

- Drawing time: "Sketch what you learned"

- Connection time: "How does this remind you of something else?"

- Clean-up as learning: "As you put away materials, tell me one thing you discovered"

### "I don't have time to do everything in the lesson plan."

**Prioritize:**
1. Opening prayer (2-3 min) — Always
2. Hands-on activity (bulk of time) — Core learning
3. Faith connection (2-3 min) — Can be woven in during activity
4. Closing (1-2 min) — Quick wrap-up

**Skip if needed:**

- Extended background information (summarize instead)

- All discussion questions (pick 1-2 key ones)

- Extensions (save for students who finish early)

### "How do I manage transitions between activities?"


- **Use timers:** Visual countdown helps everyone

- **Give warnings:** "2 minutes until we stop building"

- **Use signals:** Clap pattern, chime, raised hand

- **Make cleanup fun:** "Can you get materials put away before I count to 20?"

- **Assign jobs:** Materials manager, supply collector, etc.

## Materials & Equipment

### "I don't have the materials listed in the lesson."

**Substitution ideas:**

| Listed Material | Substitutes |
|-----------------|-------------|
| KEVA planks | Popsicle sticks, cardboard strips, blocks |
| Sphero/Dash robots | Paper coding (write steps), human robot game |
| iPads | Paper and pencil, partner work on fewer devices |
| Fancy building sets | Recycled materials (boxes, tubes, tape) |
| Science equipment | Household items (cups, spoons, water) |

### "How far ahead do I need to reserve CSCOE materials?"

**Minimum 2 weeks**, but popular items (Dash robots, Sphero) may need **3-4 weeks**. Check the [CSCOE Library](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) early in the school year and reserve for the whole semester if possible.

### "What should I always have on hand?"

**C-STREAM Essentials Box:**

- Paper (plain and construction)

- Tape (masking and clear)

- Scissors

- Markers/crayons

- Rulers

- String

- Straws

- Paper cups

- Index cards

- Recycled cardboard

### "A student broke/lost equipment. What do I do?"

1. **Stay calm** — Accidents happen
2. **Document it** — Note what happened for inventory
3. **Problem-solve** — Can another group share?
4. **Report** — Let administration know if it's expensive equipment
5. **Teach** — Use it as a lesson about responsibility and honesty

## Classroom Management

### "Students are too excited and getting wild."

**Channel the energy:**

- "Show me you're ready by sitting quietly with hands folded"

- "I need silent scientists for the next instruction"

- Give a task: "While you wait, predict what will happen..."

- Movement break: "Stand up, shake it out, sit back down"

**Prevent it:**

- Give instructions BEFORE distributing materials

- Have clear start/stop signals

- Assign roles so everyone has a job

### "One student is dominating the group work."

**Strategies:**

- Assign specific roles (materials manager, recorder, presenter)

- Use "talking chips" — each person uses one chip per contribution

- Require rotation: "After 2 minutes, pass the materials to the next person"

- Check in: "Has everyone in your group shared an idea?"

### "Some students finished early while others aren't close."

**For early finishers:**

- Extension challenges (printed and ready)

- "Can you help a friend who's stuck?"

- "Add to your design or make it better"

- "Start your reflection/journal entry"

- "Draw a diagram showing what you did"

**For students who need more time:**

- Simplify the goal: "Just focus on getting this one part to work"

- Pair with a patient helper

- Provide partial completion option

- Continue next session if possible

### "Students are arguing in their groups."

**Quick interventions:**

- "What's the disagreement about?" (Name the conflict)

- "Can you find a way to try both ideas?"

- "Rock, paper, scissors to decide?"

- "Take 30 seconds to think quietly, then share again"

**Teaching moment:**

- "Engineers often disagree — that's how ideas get better!"

- "How would Jesus want us to solve this?"

## Assessment

### "How do I grade C-STREAM?"

**Keep it simple:**

- **Participation/Effort:** Were they engaged? Did they try?

- **Process:** Did they follow the design process?

- **Reflection:** Can they explain what they learned?

- **Faith Connection:** Did they connect to Catholic values?

**Avoid** grading whether the project "worked" — that discourages risk-taking.

### "What do I put in report cards?"

Use language like:

- "Demonstrates curiosity and asks questions"

- "Perseveres through engineering challenges"

- "Collaborates respectfully with peers"

- "Connects STEM learning to faith"

- "Shows growth in problem-solving skills"

### "How do I track progress without tons of paperwork?"


- **Observation notes:** Sticky notes during class, transfer weekly

- **Photos/videos:** Quick documentation of work

- **Student reflections:** Have them self-assess

- **Exit tickets:** One quick question at the end

- **Use the [Progress Tracker](./Student_Progress_Tracker.md):** Update termly, not weekly

## Technology Troubleshooting

### "The robot won't connect/work."

**Quick fixes:**
1. **Power:** Is it charged? Turn off and on again.
2. **Bluetooth:** Is Bluetooth on? Is the device paired?
3. **App:** Close and reopen the app. Update if needed.
4. **Restart:** Turn off device, wait 30 seconds, restart.

**Backup plan:** 

- Have paper-based coding ready (write the steps on paper)

- "Human robot" activity — students give commands to each other

- Watch a video of the robot in action and discuss

### "The WiFi isn't working."

**Offline options:**

- ScratchJr works offline once downloaded

- Paper prototyping and designing

- Physical building challenges

- Discussion and planning activities

### "I don't know how to use this app/program."


- **YouTube search:** "[App name] tutorial for beginners"

- **Ask students:** They often know!

- **CSCOE:** May have training available

### "Only some devices are working."

**Adapt:**

- Partner work on functioning devices

- Rotation stations — tech station and non-tech station

- Paper-based work for those without devices

- "Unplugged" version of the activity

---

## Faith Integration

### "I forget to include the faith connection."

**Make it automatic:**

- Post the lesson's Scripture verse

- Start with prayer asking God to help us learn

- During activity, ask: "What does this tell us about God's creation?"

- End with: "How can we use what we learned to help others?"

### "The faith connection feels forced."

**Natural connections:**

- **Wonder:** "Isn't it amazing that God made this?"

- **Failure/persistence:** "God is patient with us, too"

- **Teamwork:** "We're using our gifts to help each other"

- **Creation care:** "We're being good stewards"

- **Service:** "How could this help someone?"

### "Students ask hard questions about faith and science."

**Good responses:**

- "That's a great question! Scientists and people of faith have wondered about that too."

- "Faith helps us understand WHY, science helps us understand HOW."

- "Let's think about that together."

- "That's something you could talk to [parents/pastor] about too."

## Working with Different Grades

### "I teach multiple grades at once. How do I manage?"

**Strategies:**

- Use the same theme with different complexity levels

- Older students can help younger ones

- Assign different roles by ability, not just age

- Use the same materials with different challenges

- Stagger activities (K builds while 1-2 listens to instructions)

### "Kindergartners can't do what the lesson asks."

**Simplify:**

- Shorten the activity (focus on exploration, not product)

- More adult support and guided steps

- Accept any attempt as success

- Focus on vocabulary and wonder

- Drawing instead of writing

### "5th-6th graders say the activity is 'babyish.'"

**Level up:**

- Add constraints: "Now do it with half the materials"

- Add leadership: "Can you mentor a younger student?"

- Add complexity: "Design a more advanced version"

- Add documentation: "Create a how-to guide"

- Add real-world connection: "How do actual engineers do this?"
