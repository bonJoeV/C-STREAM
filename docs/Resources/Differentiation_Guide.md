# 🌈 C-STREAM Differentiation Guide

**Location:** Our Lady of the Prairie Catholic School · Belle Plaine, MN · Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis

Practical strategies for meeting the needs of all learners in your C-STREAM classroom.

---

## 🎯 Universal Design Principles

Before modifying for individuals, build accessibility into every lesson:

| Principle | How to Apply |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Multiple means of representation** | Show AND tell. Use visuals, verbal, hands-on |
| **Multiple means of expression** | Let students show learning in different ways |
| **Multiple means of engagement** | Offer choice when possible |

---

## 👤 Students with Learning Differences

### Attention Challenges (ADHD)

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Chunk activities** | Break 30-min lesson into 3 segments with movement |
| **Provide fidgets** | Offer something to hold during listening |
| **Use timers** | Visual countdown for transitions |
| **Movement breaks** | "Stand up and stretch" between activities |
| **Clear workspace** | Only current materials on desk |
| **Proximity** | Seat near you during instructions |
| **Written + verbal** | Post steps AND say them aloud |

**What works especially well in C-STREAM:**

- Hands-on building naturally engages kinesthetic learners

- Short segments (explore → build → test → share)

- Movement built into engineering activities

---

### Reading/Writing Challenges (Dyslexia, Dysgraphia)

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Reduce writing load** | Use drawings, verbal responses, check boxes |
| **Provide templates** | Pre-printed worksheets with sentence starters |
| **Use visuals** | Picture instructions, not just text |
| **Allow dictation** | Student speaks, partner or teacher writes |
| **Larger print** | Enlarge worksheets to 125% |
| **Color coding** | Highlight key words or steps |
| **Audio options** | Read instructions aloud, use text-to-speech |

**Worksheet Modifications:**

- Use Engineering Design Process worksheet with drawing boxes

- Accept labeled diagrams instead of paragraphs

- Offer verbal project reflections

---

### Processing Differences (Autism Spectrum)

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Consistent routine** | Same structure each C-STREAM session |
| **Visual schedule** | Post lesson flow on board |
| **Prepare for transitions** | "In 2 minutes we will clean up" |
| **Reduce sensory input** | Quiet corner option, headphones available |
| **Clear expectations** | Specific, concrete instructions |
| **Social stories** | "During C-STREAM, we share materials with friends" |
| **Warn about changes** | Preview if doing something different |

**Sample Visual Schedule:**
```
1. 🙏 Prayer (2 min)
2. ❓ Wonder Question (3 min)
3. 📚 Learn Together (8 min)
4. 🔧 Build/Create (12 min)
5. 🗣️ Share (3 min)
6. 🙏 Closing Prayer (2 min)
```

---

### Motor Skill Challenges

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Larger materials** | Use bigger blocks, thicker markers |
| **Adaptive tools** | Scissors with spring return, pencil grips |
| **Partner assistance** | "You design, partner builds" |
| **Modified expectations** | Quality over quantity |
| **Alternative methods** | Stamp instead of write, voice instead of type |
| **Stable surfaces** | Tape paper down, use non-slip mats |

**Building Modifications:**

- Pre-cut materials for students who struggle with scissors

- Offer larger KEVA planks or DUPLO instead of small pieces

- Allow digital design (drawing app) instead of physical building

---

## 🚀 Advanced Learners

### Extension Strategies

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Deeper questions** | "What would happen if...?" |
| **Additional constraints** | "Now build it using only 10 pieces" |
| **Leadership roles** | Materials manager, group facilitator |
| **Peer teaching** | Help struggling classmates |
| **Research extensions** | Investigate related Catholic scientist |
| **Complex challenges** | Add variables to engineering problem |
| **Documentation** | Create how-to guide for others |

### Sample Extensions by Activity Type

| Activity | Extension |
|----------|-----------|
| **Bridge building** | Add weight-holding requirement, calculate efficiency |
| **Coding** | Add sound effects, create multi-level game |
| **Robotics** | Add sensors, create obstacle course |
| **Science investigation** | Design additional tests, graph data |
| **Engineering challenge** | Present to another class, create tutorial |

### Enrichment Questions

- "How could you make this help someone in our community?"

- "What would a professional engineer do differently?"

- "Can you teach this to a younger student?"

- "What other problems could you solve with this method?"

## 🌍 English Language Learners (ELL)

### Visual Supports

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Picture vocabulary** | Show images alongside new words |
| **Labeled diagrams** | Parts of robot, design process steps |
| **Video demonstrations** | Model before expecting output |
| **Gestures** | Use consistent hand signals |
| **Real objects** | Hold up actual materials when naming |

### Language Supports

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Sentence frames** | "I noticed _____" "My design _____" |
| **Key vocabulary preview** | 3-5 words before lesson |
| **Partner translation** | Pair with bilingual buddy |
| **Simplified instructions** | Shorter sentences, one step at a time |
| **Repeat and rephrase** | Say key ideas multiple ways |
| **Wait time** | Allow extra processing time |

### Sample Sentence Frames for C-STREAM

**For Observations:**

- "I see _____."

- "I notice _____."

- "It looks like _____."

**For Engineering:**

- "My design has _____."

- "It didn't work because _____."

- "I will change _____."

**For Collaboration:**

- "I agree because _____."

- "I have a different idea: _____."

- "Can you help me with _____?"

**For Faith Connection:**

- "This reminds me of _____."

- "God made _____ because _____."

- "We can help others by _____."

### Visual Vocabulary Cards (Key C-STREAM Terms)

Create cards with picture + word for:

- Engineer, scientist, inventor

- Design, build, test, improve

- Observe, predict, measure

- Collaborate, share, teamwork

- Create, imagine, wonder

## 💡 Lesson Planning Checklist

Before each lesson, ask yourself:

### Preparation

- [ ] Do I have visual supports for key vocabulary?

- [ ] Are instructions broken into clear steps?

- [ ] Do I have a visual schedule posted?

- [ ] Are materials accessible to all learners?

- [ ] Do I have extension activities ready?

### During Lesson

- [ ] Am I showing AND telling?

- [ ] Am I providing think time before expecting answers?

- [ ] Am I checking for understanding throughout?

- [ ] Am I offering choices where possible?

- [ ] Am I circulating and observing needs?

### Assessment

- [ ] Can students show learning in multiple ways?

- [ ] Am I looking for growth, not just mastery?

- [ ] Am I documenting what each student CAN do?

## 🤝 Collaboration with Specialists

### Who to Partner With

| Specialist | How They Can Help |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Special Education Teacher** | IEP accommodations, co-teaching |
| **Speech-Language Pathologist** | Vocabulary support, communication |
| **Occupational Therapist** | Motor accommodations, sensory needs |
| **ELL Teacher** | Language supports, cultural connections |
| **Gifted Coordinator** | Extension ideas, enrichment |

### Questions to Ask
1. "What accommodations does this student need?"
2. "What are their strengths I can build on?"
3. "What worked in other classes?"
4. "Can you co-teach or observe a lesson?"
5. "How should I modify the assessment?"
