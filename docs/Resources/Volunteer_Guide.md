## 💬 How to Talk to Students

### Instead of... Try...

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "That's wrong" | "Tell me about your design" |
| "Do it this way" | "What happens if you try...?" |
| "That won't work" | "Interesting! What do you think will happen?" |
| "Let me fix it" | "What could you change?" |
| "Good job!" | "I noticed you tried 3 different ways—that's perseverance!" |

### Great Questions to Ask

**To spark thinking:**

- "What are you trying to make?"

- "What's your plan?"

- "What do you think will happen?"

**When they're stuck:**

- "What have you tried so far?"

- "What could you try next?"

- "Who could you ask for ideas?"

**After testing:**

- "What happened?"

- "What worked well?"

- "What would you change?"

**Faith connections:**

- "What does this teach you about God's creation?"

- "How could this help someone?"

- "What are you grateful for in this project?"

## 🛠️ Working with Different Ages

### Kindergarten (25-minute sessions)

- **Need lots of support** — Stay close, help with fine motor tasks

- **Short attention spans** — Keep them focused on one step at a time

- **Encourage exploration** — There's no "wrong" at this age

- **Celebrate everything** — "Look what you made!"

### Grades 1-2 (30-minute sessions)

- **Building independence** — Let them try before helping

- **Reading support** — They may need instructions read aloud

- **Partner work** — Help them collaborate nicely

- **Encourage iteration** — "What if you tried it again?"

### Grades 3-4 (40-minute sessions)

- **More independent** — Step back, observe, intervene less

- **Group dynamics** — Help ensure everyone participates

- **Deeper questions** — Push their thinking with "why" and "how"

- **Documentation** — May need help recording their process

### Grades 5-6 (45-minute sessions)

- **Very independent** — Your role is mostly material support

- **Complex projects** — Ask about their design thinking

- **Leadership opportunities** — Can they help others?

- **Critical thinking** — Challenge them to go deeper

## 🚨 What to Do When...

### A student is frustrated
1. Acknowledge feelings: "This is tricky, isn't it?"
2. Normalize struggle: "Real engineers face problems too!"
3. Focus on process: "What have you tried?"
4. Suggest a break: "Take a breath, then look again"
5. Celebrate effort: "I see you're not giving up!"

### A project "fails"
1. Reframe it: "That's data! Now you know what doesn't work."
2. Connect to learning: "What did you learn from this?"
3. Encourage iteration: "How could you change it?"
4. Share stories: "Even famous inventors failed many times!"

### Students are arguing
1. Stay neutral: "What's the disagreement about?"
2. Facilitate: "Can you each share your idea?"
3. Problem-solve: "Is there a way to try both?"
4. Involve teacher if needed

### You don't know the answer
1. Be honest: "Great question! I'm not sure."
2. Model learning: "Let's think about this together."
3. Ask the student: "What do YOU think?"
4. Check with teacher if needed

### A student is off-task
1. Redirect gently: "What step are you on?"
2. Give a job: "Can you be the materials manager?"
3. Move closer: Sometimes proximity is enough
4. Involve teacher for persistent issues

### Technology doesn't work
1. Basic troubleshooting: Restart app, check connections
2. Have a backup: Paper and pencil work too!
3. Pair students: Share working devices
4. Stay calm: Tech problems happen to everyone

## ✝️ Faith Integration Tips

C-STREAM isn't just STEM—it's Catholic STEM! Help students make faith connections:

### Simple Connections

- "Isn't it amazing that God created all of this?"

- "How does this show God's love for us?"

- "Engineers help people—just like we're called to do!"

- "What can this teach us about being patient like God is with us?"

### When Students Struggle

- "God doesn't give up on us, and we don't give up on our projects!"

- "Making mistakes is part of how God helps us learn."

- "Let's ask God to help us figure this out."

### During Teamwork

- "How are we showing kindness to our teammates?"

- "Jesus worked with a team too—his disciples!"

- "Using our talents together is how we serve God."
