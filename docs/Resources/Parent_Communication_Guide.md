- **Faith and Reason:** Science and faith work together to reveal truth

- **Service to Others:** Students learn to use STEM skills to help their neighbors

- **Catholic Heritage:** We highlight the Church's rich history of scientific discovery

**What Will Your Child Learn?**
Your child will develop:

- Critical thinking and problem-solving skills

- Collaboration and communication abilities

- Understanding of how STEM serves the common good

- Appreciation for the harmony of faith and reason

**How Can You Help?**

- Ask your child what they learned and how it connects to our faith

- Encourage curiosity and wonder at home

- Explore science and nature together as a family

- Discuss how technology can be used responsibly

We look forward to an exciting year of learning and discovery!

In Christ,
