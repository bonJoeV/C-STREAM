# 🚀 C-STREAM Quick Start Guide

**Location:** Our Lady of the Prairie Catholic School · Belle Plaine, MN · Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis

**Welcome to C-STREAM!** This one-page guide will get you teaching in your first two weeks with minimal prep. Follow the steps below in order.

---

## ⏱️ Before Your First Day (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Know Your Time Blocks
| Grade Level | Session Length |
|-------------|----------------|
| Kindergarten | 25 minutes |
| Grades 1-2 | 30 minutes |
| Grades 3-4 | 40 minutes |
| Grades 5-6 | 45 minutes |

### Step 2: Gather Basic Supplies

These items are needed for Week 1 across all grades:


- [ ] Chart paper or whiteboard

- [ ] Markers/crayons (class set)

- [ ] Plain paper or student journals

- [ ] STREAM letter cards or poster (print from [Templates](../Templates/README.md))

- [ ] Picture of Gregor Mendel (Google Images works!)

### Step 3: Find Your Week 1 Lesson
| Your Grade | Go To |
|------------|-------|
| Kindergarten | [Lessons/Kindergarten/Week01](../Lessons/Kindergarten/Week01_Welcome_to_CSTREAM.md) |
| Grades 1-2 | [Lessons/Grades_1-2_YearA/Week01](../Lessons/Grades_1-2_YearA/Week01_Welcome_to_CSTREAM.md) |
| Grades 3-4 | [Lessons/Grades_3-4_YearA/Week01](../Lessons/Grades_3-4_YearA/Week01_Welcome_to_CSTREAM.md) |
| Grades 5-6 | [Lessons/Grades_5-6_YearA/Week01](../Lessons/Grades_5-6_YearA/Week01_Welcome_to_CSTREAM.md) |

> 💡 **Year A or Year B?** Check with your school. Year A and B alternate each year so students don't repeat content.

## 📅 Week 1: Welcome to C-STREAM

### Your One Goal This Week
**Introduce C-STREAM and spark wonder.** That's it! Don't worry about mastering everything.

### Simple Lesson Flow (All Grades)
1. **Opening Prayer** (2-3 min) — Thank God for curious minds
2. **What is C-STREAM?** (5-8 min) — Go through each letter together
3. **Meet a Catholic Scientist** (5 min) — Share Gregor Mendel's story
4. **Wonder Question** (5-8 min) — "What do you wonder about?"
5. **Goal Setting** (5-8 min) — Students draw/write one learning goal
6. **Closing Prayer** (2 min) — Ask God to help us learn

### What Success Looks Like
✅ Students can name what C-STREAM stands for  
✅ Students shared at least one "wonder question"  
✅ You finished on time (close enough counts!)

## 📅 Week 2: First Hands-On Activity

### Before Week 2

- [ ] Read your Week 2 lesson (or Week 2-3 if it's a multi-week unit)

- [ ] Check if CSCOE materials are needed — reserve 2 weeks ahead!

- [ ] Gather materials listed in the lesson

### Week 2 Tips

- **Let them struggle a little** — Productive struggle builds problem-solving skills

- **Use the Engineering Design Process** — Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve

- **Connect to faith naturally** — "What does this teach us about God's creation?"

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Lesson running long | Skip to closing prayer; finish next week |
| Lesson too short | Add sharing time: "Tell a partner what you learned" |
| Kids too excited/noisy | Channel energy: "Show me your thinking with your hands" |
| Missing materials | Improvise! Paper and pencils can substitute for many activities |
| Technology not working | Have a backup: draw designs on paper instead |

## 📚 Essential Resources

| Resource | What It's For |
|----------|---------------|

## ✝️ Remember Why We Do This

> "Science and faith are complementary – the beautiful harmony of faith and reason so students can be a light in the secular world."

C-STREAM isn't about being a perfect STEM teacher. It's about:

- **Sparking wonder** at God's creation

- **Building confidence** through hands-on learning

- **Connecting faith and reason** naturally

- **Serving others** through what we create

You've got this! 🌟
