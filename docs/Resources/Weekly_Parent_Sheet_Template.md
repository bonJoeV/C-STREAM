## Week Template: Engineering Challenge

# 🌟 This Week in C-STREAM 🌟
**Our Lady of the Prairie Catholic School**

**Week:** _____ | **Date:** _______________

**Unit:** Building Purpose with KEVA Planks

---

### 🎯 What We Learned

**Kindergarten:** We built towers and bridges with KEVA planks! We learned that patience and trying again helps us succeed, just like God is patient with us.

**Grades 1-3:** We engineered structures that could hold weight. We tested our designs, made improvements, and learned that failure is part of the engineering process—God helps us learn from our mistakes!

**Grades 4-6:** We tackled a complex engineering challenge, working as teams to design, test, and improve our structures. We discussed how engineers serve others by building things that help communities.

### 💬 Ask Your Child...

- "How many times did your structure fall before it worked?"

- "What did you change to make it stronger?"

- "How do engineers help people?"

### 🏠 Try at Home
Build a tower using index cards, playing cards, or dominoes. See how tall you can make it! Talk about what makes structures strong.

## Week Template: Coding & Algorithms

# 🌟 This Week in C-STREAM 🌟
**Our Lady of the Prairie Catholic School**

**Week:** _____ | **Date:** _______________

**Unit:** Coding with Scratch/ScratchJr

---

### 🎯 What We Learned

**Kindergarten:** We gave instructions to our characters in ScratchJr! We learned that clear directions help things work—just like following God's directions helps us live good lives.

**Grades 1-3:** We programmed sprites to move and interact in Scratch! We learned about sequences and loops, and discussed how God has an order and purpose for all of creation.

**Grades 4-6:** We created interactive stories or games in Scratch. We debugged our code when things went wrong, practicing perseverance and problem-solving.

### 💬 Ask Your Child...

- "What did your character do in your program?"

- "What happened when something didn't work right?"

- "How is coding like following directions?"

### 🏠 Try at Home
Play "Robot Commands"—one person is the "robot" and follows exact instructions from the "programmer." Try directing someone to make a sandwich or walk across the room!

## Week Template: Nature Exploration

# 🌟 This Week in C-STREAM 🌟
**Our Lady of the Prairie Catholic School**

**Week:** _____ | **Date:** _______________

**Unit:** Exploring God's Creation

---

### 🎯 What We Learned

**Kindergarten:** We explored nature and found amazing patterns! We talked about how God made everything beautiful and how we can take care of His creation.

**Grades 1-3:** We investigated living things and their habitats. We learned how plants and animals depend on each other, showing God's amazing design.

**Grades 4-6:** We studied ecosystems and the balance of nature. We discussed our responsibility as stewards of God's creation (Genesis 1:28).

### 💬 Ask Your Child...

- "What was the most amazing thing you discovered today?"

- "How do plants/animals help each other?"

- "What can our family do to care for God's creation?"

### 🏠 Try at Home
Take a nature walk and see how many different living things you can find. Count types of plants, birds, insects, etc. Talk about how they all fit together in God's plan.

**Grades 1-3:** We programmed robots to navigate paths and complete challenges. We discussed how robots can help people who need assistance.

**Grades 4-6:** We designed and programmed robots to solve problems. We explored how robotics can serve communities—helping elderly, assisting with disabilities, or exploring dangerous places.

### 💬 Ask Your Child...

- "What did your robot do today?"

- "How do you 'talk' to a robot?"

- "How could robots help people in our community?"

### 🏠 Try at Home
Design a "helpful robot" on paper. What would it do? Who would it help? How does helping others show God's love?

---

### 🎯 What We Learned

**Kindergarten:** We made patterns and shapes in our art! We found God's patterns in nature—flowers, shells, and snowflakes.

**Grades 1-3:** We explored symmetry and tessellations through art. We discovered how math and beauty come together in God's creation.

**Grades 4-6:** We investigated the golden ratio, fractals, or geometric patterns. We discussed how mathematics reveals the order and beauty God built into the universe.
