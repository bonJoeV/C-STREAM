## Welcome to C-STREAM

C-STREAM represents **Catholic** STEM education that intentionally weaves together faith and reason throughout every aspect of the curriculum. Rather than treating religion as a standalone subject, this framework integrates Catholic identity like "yeast that causes everything to rise."

!!! quote "Our Vision"
    "Science and faith are complementary – the beautiful harmony of faith and reason so students can be a light in the secular world."

## :calendar: Scheduling Flexibility

C-STREAM offers two scheduling options to fit your school's needs:

=== "Weekly Lessons (34/year)"

    Full curriculum for schools with STREAM every week.
    
    - [Kindergarten](Lessons/Kindergarten/README.md)
    - [Grades 1-2 Year A](Lessons/Grades_1-2_YearA/README.md) | [Year B](Lessons/Grades_1-2_YearB/README.md)
    - [Grades 3-4 Year A](Lessons/Grades_3-4_YearA/README.md) | [Year B](Lessons/Grades_3-4_YearB/README.md)
    - [Grades 5-6 Year A](Lessons/Grades_5-6_YearA/README.md) | [Year B](Lessons/Grades_5-6_YearB/README.md)

=== "Bi-Weekly Lessons (17/year)"

    Condensed curriculum for schools with STREAM every other week.
    
    - [Kindergarten](Lessons/Bi-Weekly/Kindergarten/README.md)
    - [Grades 1-2 Year A](Lessons/Bi-Weekly/Grades_1-2_YearA/README.md) | [Year B](Lessons/Bi-Weekly/Grades_1-2_YearB/README.md)
    - [Grades 3-4 Year A](Lessons/Bi-Weekly/Grades_3-4_YearA/README.md) | [Year B](Lessons/Bi-Weekly/Grades_3-4_YearB/README.md)
    - [Grades 5-6 Year A](Lessons/Bi-Weekly/Grades_5-6_YearA/README.md) | [Year B](Lessons/Bi-Weekly/Grades_5-6_YearB/README.md)

### Two-Year Rotation (Grades 1-6)

For combined-grade classrooms, we offer **Year A** and **Year B** versions:


- **Year A & Year B** cover the same core skills with different projects, saints, and contexts

- Students never repeat content in back-to-back years

- Kindergarten has a single track (students only experience it once)

## :trophy: The 12 Success Factors

This framework is built on twelve research-backed success factors for Catholic STEM programs:

??? abstract "1. :pray: Faith-Reason Integration"
    Present science and faith as complementary, using STEM subjects as "privileged gateways into the divine order of things."
