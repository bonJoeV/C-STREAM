# 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration Rubric

This rubric helps teachers and administrators evaluate how effectively C-STEM lessons present faith and science as complementary, aligning with the Catholic understanding that "faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth" (St. John Paul II, *Fides et Ratio*).

---

## 📋 Overview

**Purpose:** Evaluate the quality of faith integration in STEM lessons and curriculum

**Users:** Teachers (self-evaluation), Administrators (program evaluation), Curriculum developers

**Scoring:** 4 = Exemplary, 3 = Proficient, 2 = Developing, 1 = Beginning

## 🙏 Rubric Categories

### Category 1: Faith-Science Harmony

**Key Question:** Does the lesson present faith and science as complementary rather than competing?

| Score | Descriptor | Indicators |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **4 - Exemplary** | Faith and science are seamlessly integrated as "two wings" | • Faith and science presented as mutually enriching<br>• No false dichotomy between faith and reason<br>• Students clearly see how science reveals God's wisdom<br>• Wonder at creation flows naturally into both faith and scientific inquiry |
| **3 - Proficient** | Faith and science connection is clear and meaningful | • Clear connection made between STEM content and faith<br>• Students understand science as a way to study God's creation<br>• Faith enhances rather than limits scientific exploration<br>• Discussion acknowledges complementary relationship |
| **2 - Developing** | Faith is included but connection to science is superficial | • Faith elements present but feel "added on"<br>• Connection between faith and STEM content is weak<br>• Prayer included but not connected to lesson content<br>• Students may see faith and science as separate |
| **1 - Beginning** | Faith and science are treated as separate or unrelated | • Faith elements missing or disconnected<br>• Lesson could be taught identically in secular setting<br>• No acknowledgment of faith-science relationship<br>• Missed opportunities to show harmony |

**Evidence to look for:**

- [ ] Wonder questions that connect to both faith and science

| **3 - Proficient** | Prayer and wonder support the STEM learning | • Prayers relate to lesson theme<br>• At least one wonder moment included<br>• Students encouraged to see beauty in creation<br>• Faith response to learning is evident |
| **2 - Developing** | Prayer and wonder are present but generic | • Prayers are standard but not lesson-specific<br>• Wonder moments not explicitly connected to faith<br>• Awe/curiosity present but not linked to God<br>• Missed opportunities for deeper connection |
| **1 - Beginning** | Prayer and wonder are absent or disconnected | • No prayer or generic prayer unrelated to lesson<br>• No wonder/curiosity cultivation<br>• Lesson feels mechanical, not wonder-filled<br>• No invitation to see God in the learning |

**Wonder Cultivation Indicators:**

- [ ] "Have you ever wondered...?" questions

- [ ] Moments of awe at complexity/beauty of creation

- [ ] Questions that lead to both faith and scientific exploration

- [ ] Student expressions of wonder captured and honored

### Category 4: Catholic Scientific Heritage

**Key Question:** Does the lesson acknowledge the Church's contributions to science?

| Score | Descriptor | Indicators |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **4 - Exemplary** | Catholic scientific heritage is prominently featured | • Catholic scientist(s) featured with their faith story<br>• Church's contributions to science highlighted<br>• Students understand long history of Catholic science<br>• Patron saints of science referenced when relevant |
| **3 - Proficient** | Catholic scientific heritage is acknowledged | • At least one Catholic scientist mentioned<br>• Church's positive relationship with science noted<br>• Historical context of Catholic contributions shared<br>• Students aware of Catholic scientists' faith |
| **2 - Developing** | Catholic scientific heritage is briefly mentioned | • Quick mention of Catholic scientist without detail<br>• Church's science contributions not explained<br>• History acknowledged but not explored<br>• Opportunity for deeper integration missed |
| **1 - Beginning** | Catholic scientific heritage is absent | • No mention of Catholic scientists<br>• Church's contributions to science ignored<br>• Secular narrative of science only<br>• Missed opportunity to show faith-science history |

**Catholic Scientists to Consider:**

## 📋 Quick Self-Check for Teachers

Before teaching, ask yourself:

☐ **Does my lesson show faith and science as complementary?**

☐ **Is there a meaningful connection to Catholic teaching (not just prayer)?**

☐ **Will students experience wonder at God's creation?**

☐ **Have I acknowledged Catholic contributions to science (if relevant)?**

☐ **Do students see how this learning serves others?**

If you answered "no" to any question, consult the templates and resources to strengthen that area before teaching.
