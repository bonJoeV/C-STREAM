# ❤️ Service-Oriented STEM Rubric

This rubric evaluates how effectively C-STEM lessons connect STEM skills to Catholic Social Teaching and service to others—the "Hands and Feet of Christ" approach to STEM education.

> "Why do we do science and engineering? Not to make as much money as we can... but to build up our brothers and sisters in Christ."

---

## 📋 Overview

**Purpose:** Evaluate the service orientation and Catholic Social Teaching integration in STEM projects and lessons

**Users:** Teachers, project mentors, STEM fair judges, students (self-assessment)

**Scoring:** 4 = Exemplary, 3 = Proficient, 2 = Developing, 1 = Beginning

## 🙏 Catholic Social Teaching Principles

C-STEM education should connect to these seven themes of Catholic Social Teaching:

| Principle | STEM Connection |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Life and Dignity of the Human Person** | Technology should enhance human dignity, not diminish it |
| **Call to Family, Community, and Participation** | STEM skills build up communities and families |
| **Rights and Responsibilities** | We have responsibility to use technology ethically |
| **Option for the Poor and Vulnerable** | STEM can address needs of the marginalized |
| **Dignity of Work and Rights of Workers** | Technology should support, not replace, human work |
| **Solidarity** | We are one human family; STEM connects us globally |
| **Care for God's Creation** | Environmental stewardship through science and engineering |
