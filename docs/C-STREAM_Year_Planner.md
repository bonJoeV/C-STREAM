### Conversation Starters by Unit Type

**For Robotics/Coding Weeks:**
- "Can you show me how you programmed the robot?"
- "What went wrong and how did you fix it?"
- "How can robots help people?"

**For Building/Engineering Weeks:**
- "What made your structure strong?"
- "If you could rebuild it, what would you change?"
- "Who might use something like what you built?"

**For Science/Exploration Weeks:**
- "What was the most surprising thing you learned?"
- "What do you wonder about now?"
- "How does this show us God's amazing creation?"

### Parent Quick Explanations

**What is C-STREAM?**
> C-STREAM stands for Catholic Science, Technology, Religion, Engineering, Art & Music, and Mathematics. It's like STEM, but with Catholic faith woven throughout. Your child learns that faith and science work together to understand God's amazing world.

**Why Catholic STEM?**
> Catholic education has always valued both faith and reason. We help students see that the same God who inspired the Psalms also created the laws of physics. Learning about creation helps us know and love the Creator.

**How can I help at home?**
> Ask questions! Show curiosity about what your child is learning. Point out science and engineering in everyday life. Wonder aloud about how things work. Most importantly, help your child see God in the amazing world around them.
