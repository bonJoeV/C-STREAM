# 👋 About the Author

## Joe Vandermark

![Joe Vandermark](assets/images/joe-vandermark.jpg){ align=right width=230 }

With more than 30 years in technology, I'm passionate about helping people understand how computers, cloud systems, and new tools make life and work better. I created the C-STREAM Framework to bring that same spirit of innovation into Catholic education—nurturing both the mind and spirit.

!!! quote "My Philosophy"
    STREAM learning gives every student the confidence to explore, ask questions, and build the future with both skill and heart.
