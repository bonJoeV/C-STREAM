## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

### Respect Catholic Values
All lesson plans, resources, and materials must align with Catholic values and teachings. C-STREAM is built on the foundation that faith and reason are complementary.

### Maintain Grade Appropriateness

| Grade | Time | Approach |
|-------|------|----------|
| Kindergarten | 25 min | Wonder, exploration, simple hands-on |
| Grades 1-2 | 30 min | Guided exploration with structure |
| Grades 3-4 | 40 min | Independent work with collaboration |
| Grades 5-6 | 45 min | Complex projects, student-led inquiry |

### Follow the 12 Success Factors
Ensure contributions align with the [12 Success Factors](index.md) for Catholic STEM education.

### Use Consistent Formatting

- Follow existing file naming conventions

- Use provided templates

- Include proper YAML frontmatter

- Add breadcrumb navigation

### Test Your Contributions
If contributing a new lesson plan:

- Test in a classroom setting if possible

- Note any challenges or modifications needed

- Include setup time and preparation requirements

### Integrate Faith Meaningfully
Don't just add a prayer at the beginning—weave Catholic identity throughout like "yeast that causes everything to rise."
