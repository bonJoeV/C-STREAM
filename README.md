## ⏱️ Lesson Time Frames by Grade

| Grade Level | Session Length | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Kindergarten** | 25 minutes | Focus on wonder, exploration, simple hands-on activities |
| **Grades 1-2** | 30 minutes | Guided exploration with structured activities |
| **Grades 3-4** | 40 minutes | Independent work with collaboration opportunities |
| **Grades 5-6** | 45 minutes | Complex projects, deeper investigation, student-led inquiry |

---

## 📆 Scheduling Flexibility

C-STREAM offers two scheduling options to fit your school's needs:

| Schedule | Sessions | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **[Weekly Lessons](./Lessons/)** | 34 lessons per year | Schools with dedicated weekly STREAM time |
| **[Bi-Weekly Lessons](./Lessons/Bi-Weekly/)** | 17 sessions per year | Schools with STREAM every other week |

### Two-Year Rotation (Grades 1-6)
For combined-grade classrooms, we offer **Year A** and **Year B** versions:
- **Year A & Year B** cover the same core skills with different projects, saints, and contexts
- Students never repeat content in back-to-back years
- Kindergarten has a single track (students only experience it once)

## What is C-STREAM?

C-STREAM represents **Catholic** STEM education that intentionally weaves together faith and reason throughout every aspect of the curriculum. Rather than treating religion as a standalone subject, this framework integrates Catholic identity like "yeast that causes everything to rise."

The **"A" in C-STREAM** encompasses **Arts** (both visual and musical), emphasizing digital creation tools:
- 🎨 **Digital Art**: Drawing apps, graphic design, animation, 3D modeling
- 🎵 **Digital Music**: Composition apps, sound design, audio editing, coding music

> "Science and faith are complementary – the beautiful harmony of faith and reason so students can be a light in the secular world."

---

## The 12 Success Factors

This framework is built on twelve research-backed success factors for Catholic STEM programs:

### 1. 🙏 Faith-Reason Integration (The "R" in C-STREAM)
Present science and faith as complementary, using STEM subjects as "privileged gateways into the divine order of things."

### 2. 📋 NCEA's 10 Characteristics of STREAM Schools
Alignment with National Catholic Education Association standards for excellence in Catholic STEM education.

### 3. 🔧 Hands-On, Project-Based Learning
Students apply leading-edge technology to "hands-on, minds-on projects" that build critical thinking and collaboration.

### 4. ❤️ Service-Oriented STEM Applications
Connect STEM skills to Catholic social teaching through "Hands and Feet of Christ" projects.

### 5. 🔗 Cross-Curricular Integration
Intentionally connect disciplines – math, science, art, music, religion, and language arts.

### 6. ⚖️ Balance with Traditional Subjects
STEM receives emphasis but not at the expense of other subjects; maintain the whole-child approach.

### 7. 🌱 Start Early
Begin high-quality STEM education as soon as children enter elementary school.

### 8. 👩‍🏫 Teacher Professional Development
Investment in educator training on bringing faith and reason together in the classroom.

### 9. 💡 21st Century Skills Focus
Emphasize problem-solving, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking.

### 10. ⛪ Catholic Heritage in Science
Leverage the Church's rich scientific legacy (Mendel, Copernicus, Pasteur, Lemaître, and more).

### 11. 🤝 Community and Industry Partnerships
External connections with parishes, universities, and industry partners enhance programs.

### 12. ✨ Wonder and Curiosity as Foundation
Approach education from the perspective of wonder, exploration, and faith.
